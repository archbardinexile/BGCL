## Session 18 (996, Roscidas 19th)

### Ingenium

- **Arti** meets *Zephan Calligo* and *Eureka Midnight* at the Ingenium Inventors Association.
  - Arti asks if they can build engines to fly an earthmote into the Miasma. This would take too long.
  - Arti asks if the inventors can enhance the lanterns. They would need Arxian glass. They direct Arti to meet with Professor *Roshia Cralee*, sea-elf graviturgist and Gomruss' former tutor, who is working on a new type of glass armour in Arx.

- **Guy** searches for the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle.
  - The rifle can be pre-ordered for 3000 gold.
  - The prototype rifle can be stolen from a warehouse. It is guarded and protected by a magical lock which can be dispelled on a successful DC 14 spellcasting ability check.

- The party investigate the factory where the submarine is being constructed. The submarine is a second generation deep-sea exploration vehicle designed to explore the *Vena Trench*.

### Caelum's Landing

- **Gomruss** must settle his debts at *The Hearty Tankard* on Roscidas 19th.
  - The drunken half elf can be paid off for ***20 gold***.
  - The angry farmer can be paid off for ***200 gold***. Gomruss may choose to challenge the debt.
    - The farmer will take Gomruss to court on a failed persuasion check or employ the party to work off Gomruss' debt on the farm.
  - The Debt Collectors can be paid off for ***500 gold***. Gomruss may choose to challenge the debt.
  - The Debt Collectors work for the *Combe Shipping and Courier Agency*, who may have deliberately shipped 5000 Dice Monarchs sets instead of 500.
    - 2-4 ***Thugs*** will start a brawl on a failed persuasion check. Thugs use ***Pack tactics.***
    - Gomruss may overhear the debt collectors boasting about how they beat up *Nickelfoot* in order to force the deep gnome to revoke his statement.
      - Gomruss may blackmail the thugs with this information. Gomruss may discover the thugs were working for the *Garnetgrinder Clan* at this time.

- **Arti** must attend a hearing to convince the Sol Orbis family, the Grand Inquisitor and Chairman that blood magic is an acceptable risk to explore the Miasma.

### Spirit Temple

- **Arti** proposes the monks can fly an earthmote into the Miasma. They agree to assemble a team.

- **Firien** meets *Keijo* who will join the team.

### Quests

### Find Naal Berevan

Naal was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Constable *Denover*'s proposal to send in his own undercover agent was refused so he couldn't interfere.

- The Crosscut Circle may kidnap **Blythe** if her snooping proves a hindrance.
  - Camren may try to recruit Blythe and test her resolve by ordering her to deface the statue of Caelum.
  - The Crosscut Circle intend to steal a submarine being transported from Ingenium to Fundus. They wish to use this to recover the body of Tenebrae (Arzhang).

### Clear the Haunted Mine

The party may choose to assist *Lenna Madizos* in clearing out the Haunted Mine.

- **Will-o'-Wisp CR 2.** Vulnerable to radiant, thunder and lightning damage and turn undead. ***Consume Terror.*** Will-o'-wisp creates a terrifying illusion as a bonus action. On failed DC 10 WIS save, target is ***frightened*** and will-o'-wisp gains 3d4 hit points.

### Capture a Basilisk

A mission issued to the Commission by the Church of Caelum. Capture a Basilisk using an Imprison Creature scroll. The Church may be harvesting basilisk venom in preparation as tensions rise again with Mallia.

- Travel to 2d12 location by glider or airship.
- **Basilisk CR 2.** ***Bite.*** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d6+2 piercing + 2d6 poison.
- **Young Basilisk CR 1.** ***Bite.*** +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d4+1 piercing + 1d4 poison.
- Players must be careful of *petrifying gaze*

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry cannot confirm the existence of the fallen miner as there is no paper trail. Therefore the implementation of better health and safety in the mines is on hold. The miner who fell was in fact an illusion created by an agent of the *Mining Consortium* in order to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from *Micantrum* instead of the *Garnetgrinder Clan*.

- Snicker Nickelfoot is in the mining village on the Resonant Mines.
- Gerti Garnetgrinder despises that she comes from a banking family, but does not speak ill of her parents.

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* is offering work clearing out a buried tomb in Os Terrae. The airship to Arx won't depart until Darshan has finished his work at Crowswood Place.
