title: The New Sol Orbis Calendar
---

There are 12 months in one year. Each month is 24 days long, divided into four six-day weeks. The days are named: *Menoday*, *Skewday*, *Winday*, *Mariday*, *Sterday* and *Sunday*. A year is divided into four seasons according to the climate. Due to the way the world of Fio rotates on all three of its axes, the summer and winter solstices only occur once every four years. A period of four years is known as a *fewyear*.

The years before Caelum's battle with Mundi Eversor are suffixed with *AO*, meaning *Ante Orientem* or *Before the Rising*, while the years after are suffixed with *PO*, meaning *Post Orientem* or *After the Rising*.
