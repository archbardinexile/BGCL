title: Exploration
---

While exploring the [Relief](getting-started#the-relief) and delving into the depths of the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma), you may discover new regions and [earthmotes](#earthmotes) yet to be charted. When navigating through the skies, an essential piece of equipment is the *six-point compass*; a spherical device that can not only determine the direction of magnetic north, but also provide the elevation of one's destination. A third perpendicular axis on the compass traps a small lead pellet at one end, and a pocket of air at the other, providing wary explorers with the means to always know which way is up. In addition to north, east, south and west, *skew* is used to denote an elevation of 90° (directly above the observer), while *erde* is used to denote an elevation of 270° (directly below the observer). For example, [Nox](glacialis#nox), a high-altitude earthmote in the northernmost region of [Glacialis](glacialis), would be *skew-north* of the observer when viewed from [Caelum's Landing](profundus#caelums-landing).

##### **Glider Proficiency**

Those wishing to explore the skies without the aid of public transportation may visit *Caelum's Landing University* in order to gain their *glider proficiency*. Gliders are the simplest and cheapest way to traverse the skies between earthmotes, and are as commonplace as the humble bicycle. They come in single and two-seat variants, while some larger gliders even come equipped with small resonance engines to travel longer distances. Adventurers beware: most personal gliders are not built to handle strong winds and stormy weather. Hiring an airship is strongly recommended for more taxing journeys.

### Earthmotes

Earthmotes are pieces of land that, due to the influence of magic, float above the ground. Despite their appearance, earthmotes are as durable and stable as any island at sea level. Every earthmote is unique in size, shape and altitude. A few move either in programmed routes or erratically, but most are stationary, hovering near an earthbound feature. Disruptions, whether natural or magical, don't have any effect on an earthmote's ability to float.

You can determine the size of an earthmote or region using the ***Size*** table below. You can then determine that earthmote's biome type by selecting features from ***Biomes*** table or by rolling dice to randomise what you find as you travel. When crossing into a new region, you may wish to re-roll one or more dice to determine how the landscape changes. It is more common to finder colder landscapes in polar regions and hotter landscapes in equatorial regions. However, due to the way some earthmotes travel, you may discover a permafrost earthmote on its way south, slowly melting as the temperature rises. It is also possible to find coastal earthmotes drifting with ocean currents or coral reef earthmotes floating below sea level.

The Biomes table also shows which encounter tables from ***Xanathar's Guide to Everything*** to use when traversing the biome. You can also use the ***Weather*** table found in the ***Dungeon Master's Guide*** to determine the temperature, wind and precipitation.

##### **Settlements and Portals**

When you roll an 11, you may re-roll that die and add an appropriate settlement, stronghold or ruin to the biome you discover. For example, you may roll an 11 and a 1, then re-roll a 3. In this case you may discover a settlement of igloos on an ice sheet. It is up to you whether the settlement is still populated.

When you roll a 12 a planar portal may be present. Re-roll that die and add a portal of your choice to the biome you discover. For example, you may roll a 12 and a 7, then re-roll an 8. A portal to the elemental plane of fire may turn an alpine lake into a bubbling hot spring, or a portal to the Feywild may alter the surrounding flora in strange ways.

### Weather (DMG, p. 109)

You can pick weather to fit your campaign or roll on the Weather table to determine the weather for a given day, adjusting for the terrain and season as appropriate.

##### **Weather**

| d20   | Temperature                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1-14  | normal for the season                          |
| 15-17 | 1d4 × 10 degrees Fahrenheit colder than normal |
| 18-20 | 1d4 × 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than normal |

##### **Wind**

| d20   | Wind        |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1-12  | no wind     |
| 13-17 | light wind  |
| 18-20 | strong wind |

##### **Precipitation**

| d20   | Precipitation                |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 1-12  | no precipitation             |
| 13-17 | light rain or light snowfall |
| 18-20 | heavy rain or heavy snowfall |

### Psychosis

Venturing into the Miasma for long periods without protection or being maimed by one of the aberrations within can lead to a special condition called psychosis. Psychosis is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of psychosis, as specified in the effect's description.

##### **Psychosis Table**

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | The creature inhales Miasma exuded from the environment or an attack and is ***poisoned***                                                        |
| 2     | The creature becomes dizzy and its speed is halved                                                                                                |
| 3     | The creature experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on saving throws                                                               |
| 4     | The creature's skin tone becomes pallid, its eyes turn purple and its hit point maximum is halved                                                 |
| 5     | The creature suffers extreme paranoia and must use its action each round to attack the nearest creature                                           |
| 6     | The creature becomes an ***aberration***. It can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way |

If a psychotic creature suffers another effect that causes psychosis, its current level of psychosis increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of psychosis as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 psychosis has its speed halved and is poisoned.

An effect that removes psychosis reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all psychosis effects ending if a creature's psychosis level is reduced below 1. If a psychotic creature is targeted by an effect that neutralises poison, that effect has a duration of 1 hour. The creature is then poisoned again unless its psychosis level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1, provided that the creature is outside the Miasma and has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1. A ***lesser restoration*** reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1. A ***greater restoration*** reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1d4+1.
