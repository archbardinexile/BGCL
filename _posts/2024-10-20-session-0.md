A brass pillar of *Madanau*'s community, Firien Madizos received the divine blessing of *Bahamut* six months ago when their home was attacked by fiends from the Miasma. Consigned to studying at the *Oratory* among the Caelumites, they have been asked to help staff the Guilds Exhibition at Caelum's Landing. Perhaps these pastries from home will help placate the crowd.

### Gomruss Yardos Bandorul (Ethan)

| Race              | Class               | Background |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |

| --- | --- | -------- | --- |
| 11  | 14  | INT, WIS | 9   |

Gomruss Yardos Bandorul found brief but bountiful success after inventing the popular game *Dice Monarchs*. Unfortunately, his penchant for gambling has landed him in tremendous debt. Rejected by Caelum's Landing University and several arcane guilds, Gomruss is on his way to the Guilds Exhibition in hopes of finding a new job; a difficult task with debt collectors on your golden tail.

### Arti (Josie)

| Race      | Class             | Background   |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Warforged | Barbarian (Beast) | Investigator |

| AC  | DC  | ST       | PP  |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- |
| 18  | N/A | STR, CON | 13  |

A hulking automaton with the guise of a plague doctor, Arti has few memories to their name. They awoke in the Miasma not a fortnight ago with only a curious lantern and flashes of their master's face to guide them. They have made their way to the Relief in hopes of finding the key to unlocking their memories. An alcove in their chest seems to suggest a part of them is missing.

### ??? (Oak)

| Race     | Class                  | Background   |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Half-Elf | Ranger (Gloom Stalker) | Investigator |

| AC  | DC  | ST       | PP  |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- |
| 17  | N/A | STR, DEX | 15  |

An amateur detective from *Tenebrae's Refuge*, this sly half-elf is headed to Caelum's Landing, hot on the trail of a missing person. *Naal Berevan*, a young and ambitious silver-haired acolyte of Caelum, has not written to his family in months. Perhaps they could make enquiries at the Guilds Exhibition.

### Guy Brush (Joe)

| Race     | Class                | Background |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Half-Elf | Rogue (Swashbuckler) | Noble      |

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

| AC  | DC  | ST       | PP  |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- |
| 15  | N/A | DEX, CHA | 12  |

Disenchanted with his life as a noble from the Kingdom of Diamante, this dashing half-elf has thrown his lot in with a crew of pirates from the Manyshells. Having disappointed his captain, *Bhaldrom Anchorheart*, for a final time, Brush has been given an ultimatum: retrieve a resonance pistol for his clamorous captain, or face the wrath of *Umberlee*.

### ??? (Rachael)

| Race  | Class                | Background |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Human | Fighter ()           | Noble      |

| 17  | 12  | 15  | 10  | 12  | 6   |

| AC  | DC  | ST       | PP  |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- |
|     |     |          |     |

An affair with the queen of the *Kingdom of Diamante* has lead to this cocksure human's downfall. He must now assume a new identity to make ends meet. Perhaps the Guilds Exhibition could offer him a fresh start.
