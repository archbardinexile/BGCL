title: The Hangover
---

While **Firien** nurses the elf's cut hand, **Bantonio** and **Blythe** get to know Constable *Denover* a little better. More talkative after three beers, Denover reveals that at twelve years of age he planted an illegal substance in the bedroom of his friend's stepfather, after his investigation revealed he was being unfaithful and abusive. Though Denover owned up, the stepfather was put under scrutiny and arrested. Denover meanwhile was sent to Sunday school as punishment. Since then, he always wanted to join the *Inland Guard*.

Denover falls asleep and Blythe is able to take a peek at the constable's notebook. It shows the tasks he has completed since the start of the year, everything from arrests to traffic control. More recently, the task to inform *Cade* and *Silas Beckonhand* of their father's death has been checked. Circled beside the entry are the words *no will?* Furthermore, it appears Denover is working with the *Inquisition* to find the *Crosscut Circle*'s hideaway. Several locations are crossed out, revealing that Denover has had no success. He intends to pitch an idea to his superiors involving an agent joining the Crosscut Circle undercover.

When Blythe shares this with Bantonio, his world is once again turned upside down. Firien has to confirm for him the existence of a secret police within the *Church of Caelum*. Bantonio retires to his room to contemplate. **Arti** meanwhile attempts to glean more information on *Lathraia's* ritual. According to him, the ritual is irreversible. Derived from his research into other blood hunter orders, it involves standing within a protective rune and inhaling a treated miasmatic solution. A blood hunter is effectively granted immunity from the effects of the Miasma, but must be careful not to trigger psychosis by abusing their abilities.

Arti goes on to question *Hadley* about her lanterns. Given she cannot craft enough in time, Arti questions if the current lanterns can instead be enhanced. Hadley tears up when Arti pressures her and she rushes out of *The Dragon's Chalice*. Lathraia reassures Arti that she will be fine.
