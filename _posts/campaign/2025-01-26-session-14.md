### Crowswood Place

A magical green fire is the only source of illumination as **Arti** finds themself staring at the ceiling of a dilapidated cottage. They are paralysed, the metal of their body cold to the touch. They hear humming; a tune they do not recognise. Arti's dream visitor once again looms over them, thousands of ethereal hands protruding from its torso and back. They reach into Arti's chest to begin weaving magical fibres. Arti perceives wisps of darkness bleeding from beneath the figure's cascading hair and a glint of purple where its left eye should be. Arti returns to consciousness in *Hadley*'s workshop.

Arti takes a moment to amend their drawing of the dream visitor and memorise the tune it was humming. They then seek out *Adelaide* in her office. Arti finds the Commission's chief in dire need of caffeine after an all-nighter and makes her a coffee. Arti offers to spearhead today's meeting with the Exarch. Adelaide agrees and she, Arti and *Hadley* convene with **Firien** in the *Wind District* while **Guy**, **Gomruss**, **Blythe** and **Bantonio** go shopping.

### The Oratory

*Aura* awaits the Crows in the main hall. Still somewhat lethargic, Adelaide introduces her companions and defers to Arti to deliver their proposal. The warforged offers the hefty document to the Exarch and eloquently paraphrases their plan to use *Lathraia*'s blood hunter ritual to traverse the Miasma and find *Glimback*. Aura seems perturbed at first so Arti reassures her by explaining the risks involved and the measures they will take to mitigate them. When questioned, Hadley is able to describe the details of the ritual itself.

> "The Miasma is the very blight released upon this land by Caelum's ultimate foe. To take the Miasma into oneself would directly oppose the fundamental beliefs of the Church. How can I approve of such a sacrifice?"
>
> "Isn't the sacrifice worth making if we can help purify the Miasma in Caelum's name?"
>
> *Arti persuades Aura.*

After some debate, Aura suggests she would be willing to approve Arti's proposal provided they limit the ritual to as few volunteers from the Commission as possible. Aura would also require they use blood magic sparingly; for protection inside the Miasma and for healing those afflicted by psychosis. Adelaide agrees and Aura takes her leave, stating that she will read the full proposal and send word of her decision as soon as she is able. Firien, perplexed that Aura should be so receptive, believes that Arti may have impressed upon her the hope that they might discover a way to rid Fio of the Miasma.
