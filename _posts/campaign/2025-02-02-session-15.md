title: Session 15 The Minister and the Murderer—Part 1
---

While the *Six of Steel* take lunch, **Firien** discusses with *Hlynur* the druids' progress restoring the oasis on their home earthmote of *Madanau*. According to the Archdruid, though the portal has been stabilised, its connection to the elemental plane of water will occasionally falter, causing it to belch hellish sludge. The druids continue to research the phenomenon using *Pen Fynnon*'s own portal as an example. Hlynur the offers the Six of Steel use of Pen Fynnon's teleportation circle so they might complete their errands promptly. While *Falvalor* offers a farewell to **Blythe**, **Bantonio** coos over the goldfinch that has begun to make a nest in **Arti**'s alcove.

### Sun District

The party step onto the teleportation circle and find themselves outside the gates of *Caelum's Landing University*, a short walk from the *Sun District*. The party's first errand is to leave an anonymous tip at the *Inland Guard* barracks on *Saint Lydia's Way*. Blythe is able to slip a note to the receptionist without being noticed. When the receptionist reads the note warning of *Silas Beckonhand*'s guilt, she rushes to *Denover*'s office. Next, the party visit the *Bounty Hunters Lodge* and employ *Gerti* to send a 25-word message to *Cade*.

> "Cade, the Six of Steel want you to meet them on Little Nox ASAP—that's one word, right? Aww crap! Erm... it's about Silas. Okay bye."
>
> "Huh? Who's that? Oh, it's a sending! Erm... heading to Tenebrae's Refuge to fight ghosts, can meet up straight after. How many words is that? Does it count-"
>
> *Gerti to Cade.*

Arti spots that the Six of Steel have been added to the hunters leader board. While they are ranked last, the *Feywild Ones* currently rank seventh. Finally, the party visit *Crowswood Place* and receive *Clara*'s letter for *Laucian Alendis*, the newly appointed Prefect of *Tenebrae's Refuge*. With their tour complete, the party return to CLU and pay for passage to Tenebrae's Refuge. The volunteer conducting the teleportation warns of ghosts in the mines. The party assume the Feywild Ones have the situation in hand and step onto the runic circle.

### Haunted Mine

Swept momentarily into the *Ethereal Plane*, Bantonio watches as each of his friends are snatched from his view. He finds himself alone in a dark cavern. The glowing teleportation circle at his feet flickers purple as if disrupted. He ignites a torch and calls for his friends. Following a hint of sunlight, Bantonio discovers that the exit has been barricaded, indicating the mine has been evacuated. Bantonio plants his torch and draws an arrow in the dirt so as not to lose his way. As he does, he spies footprints that allude to an urgent escape.

Meanwhile, **Gomruss** materialises in a separate chamber. The only illumination comes from a purple crystalline ore in the walls. Momentarily panicked, Gomruss does not recognise the ore until he feels it disrupting his magical abilities. Resonite! Realising he might refine the ore to create a resonance gem, he breaks off a shard and pockets it. Entering the next chamber, Gomruss comes across a ball of light. It approaches and Gomruss feels an intense dread as the light morphs into a familiar draconic figure.

> "I'm very disappointed in you, Gomruss."
>
> "FAAAAATHEEEEER!?"
>
> *Gomruss sees through the illusion.*

Gomruss' voice echoes throughout the mine, alerting the rest of the party to the danger—will-o'-wisps. Firien climbs the stairs to the central chamber, but is waylaid by an unwelcome illusion. Angered by the sight of their wayward sibling, Firien unleashes a thunderwave, blasting the forsaken soul out of their way.

> "I'm sorry, Yrevi. But I don't need you any more. You, mum, dad... you're just holding me back."
>
> *Firien is enraged by the illusion.*

**Guy**, Arti and Blythe charge into the central chamber, following the deafening crack of Firien's thunderwave. Three will-o'-wisps block their path to the teleportation circle and the exit beyond. Bantonio spots his friends in the dim light. He rushes to help them, only for an elegant imposter to sneak up behind him.

> "It would have been easier if you had stayed dead!"
>
> "That it your first mistake, my friend. She is much more beautiful in person."
>
> *Bantonio challenges the royal imposter.*
