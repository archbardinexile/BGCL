> *Gomruss to Dinkum.*

Outraged by the interruption of a poignant moment, **Gomruss** almost bursts *Dinkum*'s eardrums. *Zephan*'s steel defender explains there is something wrong with the warforged workers. The party follow Dinkum to the foundry floor and watch a goblin fly across the room and crash into the smelter. Eight warforged detach from their stations and begin to harass the employees. Two larger, fire-resistant warforged working the smelter approach the party brandishing white hot blades. Panicked, **Blythe** looses an explosive arrow at the nearest large construct, knocking it back ten feet!

**Arti** makes a break for the warforged stations, thinking it might be possible to shut down the workers remotely. **Firien** stands stalwart between the warforged and the fleeing employees. With a burst of radiant magic, tiny golden dragons begin to flit around them, slowing the constructs' advance and searing their wooden components. With a mote of graviturgy, Gomruss lifts a globule of molten resonite from the smelter and catapults it into the nearest warforged. Though it seems to weather the damage, the resonite begins to cool, slowing the construct.

*Eureka* peppers the warforged with magic stones, attempting to draw their attention. One warforged takes the opportunity to attack Arti but stays its blade at the last moment. Zephan, **Guy** and **Bantonio** protect Arti's flank as they plug into the first station. Thinking fast, Arti commands the nearest warforged to stand down. To their surprise, the warforged complies and its eyes turn from red to blue. Unsure how their command worked, Arti turns to his friends for advice.

> *Bantonio flirts with Zephan.*

The first fire-resistant warforged launches two white hot javelins that puncture Blythe's armour. Despite this, Blythe's poise does not falter. She looses a shocking arrow and pierces the large construct's neck, stunning it. The second attempts to crush the dazed goblin beneath its foot. Fortunately, *Droop* rolls out of the way in time. While Firien covers Droop's escape, Gomruss places a chip of mica on his tongue and bellows! Five warforged are caught in the shattering sphere, splintering their inorganic armour. One clatters to the ground, deactivated. Guy seizes the opportunity to try his new hand cannon, blasting the dazed constructs with shrapnel.
