##### **Desert Nomad**

You are particularly familiar with desert environments and are adept at travelling and surviving in such regions.

While travelling for an hour or more in desert terrain, you gain the following benefits:

- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
- Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while travelling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

##### **Githzechi Psionics**

You know the *gust* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *earth tremor* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *blur* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spell-casting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), they don't require components.
