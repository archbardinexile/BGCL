Contritus, the easternmost region, is broken by the far-reaching archipelagos of [Gwerdowra](#gwerdowra) and the [Manyshells](#the-manyshells). To the south-east, the enormous jungle earthmote [Mallia](#mallia) appears to drain the sea with curtains of vines that veil its shores.

### Gwerdowra

When the archipelagos to the far east protested against oppressive CSCA trade influence, the islands of Gwerdowra banded together to form a coalition government with *Anchora* as its capital. Having thwarted the CSCA's expansion, their nascent military, the [Free Trade Navy](../factions#free-trade-navy), now police the eastern seas.

### The Manyshells

North of Mallia, this archipelago of diminutive isles bears a colloquial name since the CSCA monopolised trade in the region. Despite the Church's influence, the Manyshells have become a reliable refuge for pirates, cultists, adrenaline junkies and other counter cultures.

#### **Libertalia**

This independent city state sits between Gwerdowra and the Manyshells on an island broken by branching rivers of sparkling aquamarine. It is the chosen home of a loose alliance of pirates, privateers and merchant crews. This shanty city's government frequently changes, favouring those with the largest fleets and the greatest wealth.

### Mallia

Erupting from the sea erde-south-east of Fundus in the year [976 PO](../timeline#976-po), Mallia is the largest earthmote in the Relief. This impenetrable jungle peninsula floats just above sea level, with thick vines cascading over its shores like medusan hair. The landmass continues into the Miasma, but none on the earthmote dare venture past the border. It is the home of the Mallian culture, a unification of reptilian races ruled by the greater medusan queen, [Vasilissa](../characters#vasilissa). The queen is known to bless only the most powerful and loyal of her subjects with the very curse she bears in order to create the infamous medusan warriors that command her armies. Mallia currently stands fractured between those loyal to the queen and those who have found sanctuary in the Church of Caelum. The rainforest serves as the border between these two factions.
