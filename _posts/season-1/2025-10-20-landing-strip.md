title: Landing Stripâ€”996, Inceptum 21st
---

Extracts from the *Landing Strip* newspaper dated 996, Inceptum 21st, Sunday.

> **World looks to new horizon!**
>
> On Inceptum 15th, The world was left stunned as the Miasma to the West diminished to reveal a horizon unseen since the Rising, 996 years ago. Since what some have dubbed 'the most eventful Menoday in recorded history', peoples across the Relief have been waiting on tenterhooks for the Church's plan of action. Exarch Aura Sol Orbis finally delivered her statement yesterday to an uproarious crowd.
>
> "While this new frontier presents new opportunities for exploration and eventually expansion, we must not ignore its perils. We must not let slip our morals, for they are what define us in this ever-changing world."
>
> While the statement was rife with religious platitudes, it was not wholly without controversy. Some took the Exarch's meaning as a warning against further expeditions into the region, perhaps indicating the Church has plans of its own. Faced with this uncertainty, others have declared the new horizon a blessing from Caelum. What is certain is that those hoping for a concrete explanation to this strange phenomenon have been left utterly dissatisfied.
