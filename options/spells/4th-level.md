## **Imprison Creature**

*4th-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flask, locket or playing card)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and a sustained arc of magical energy connects the target to the flask (or similar item) in your hand. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points before the spell ends, it shrinks to an imperceptible height and is imprisoned inside the flask. While inside the flask, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.

The flask becomes a magical item with 10 charges: while holding it, you can use an action to call forth the creature you imprisoned. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature disappears back into the flask when it drops to 0 hit points or when you use an action to end the spell. The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you expend the flask's last charge, or the flask is destroyed, the creature is released and flees. The creature can attempt to break free of the flask at the end of every day provided that it has an Intelligence score higher than 2. It must succeed on a DC 20 Strength check or remain imprisoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 and the DC increases by 2 for each slot level above 4th.
