##### **Beckonhand's Treasure**

*Silas*, *Kurt*'s adopted nephew, came to the lighthouse to discover Kurt creating a will. Silas discovers Kurt has written a puzzle for *Cade*, his son, as a clue to the whereabouts of his treasure. Solving the puzzle, Silas decides to rewrite the will, sending his cousin into a trap while he goes to find the real treasure. He then pushes Kurt out of the lighthouse window.

The fake will points to the *Dawnroot Forest* where a snake pit trap waits for Cade. *Dawnroot Druids* could aid his escape. The real will pointed to a cave on *Little Nox*, where Kurt has stashed 1000 gold worth of whiskey. Silas will be angry at the lack of treasure.
