---

An extract from a songbook purchased by Bantonio at Firerocks Tower. Though entitled *Saint Lydia's Song*, the writer remains unknown.

> There's a fire burning  
> And I'm learning to be  
> So much more than my tiredness  
> So much more than that old witch sleep wishes  
> She kisses my eyelids  
> And I breathe  
>  
> You don't have to be brilliant  
> She says as she scrolls  
> Through the rolls that the millions  
> Of hollering hollow folk know how to play  
> It's okay  
> They're just shadows searching for light  
> They can't stay  
>  
> Sleep now, oh, she says  
> Tomorrow's jokes have yet to be laughed at or said  
> Just rest now, she moans  
> Then the hollow folk come  
> Pour me wine by my bed  
> And their dead hollers hum at the things that I've said  
> And say no, no, no, no  
>  
> Cos you are in the earth of me  
> You are in the earth of me  
> My head's not yours it's mine  
> Cos you are in the earth of me  
>  
> Somehow now I'm drinking  
> And I'm lifting my glass  
> To that last good man grace  
> Who has left me, he's left me at last  
> And I laugh, and I laugh  
> Cos laughing right now, it's all, all that I have  
>  
> You're better than this  
> He says as a hand slaps my face as I stand  
> And say no good man grace  
> I can't do this (you can)  
> I can't do this (you can)  
> I can't do this (you can)  
> I can't do this you don't understand  
>  
> Sleep now, she pleads  
> You're not a coward cos you cower  
> You brave because they broke you  
> Yet broken still you breathe  
> So breathe, breathe just breathe  
>  
> Then the hollow folk pour me  
> Another shard full of glass  
> And I toast to their talents  
> And I forgive them at last  
> Cos I know, oh I know, I know  
>  
> That you are in the earth of me  
> You are in the earth of me  
> My head's not yours it's mine  
> And I'll take my fucking time  
> Cos I know, I know, I know  
>  
> I'm all yours  
> You're all mine  
> Let's dance together  
> You and I  
>  
> Cos I'm not trapped  
> With you you see  
> You're the one who's  
> Trapped with me  
>  
> Cos I've been here so many times before  
> Don't you think I look pretty  
> Curled up on this bathroom floor  
> Cos where you see weakness I see wit  
> Sometimes I fall to pieces  
> Just to see what bits of me don't fit  
>  
> Cos I when I stand oh those folks will run  
> And tell the tales of what I've become  
> They'll speak of me in whispered tones  
> And say my name like it shakes their bones  
>  
> Cos we'll dance together so close we're sharing breath  
> But now I'm leading doesn't that just scare you to death  
>  
> Cos I'm all yours  
> You're all mine  
> Let's dance together  
> You and I  
>  
> Cos I'm not trapped  
> With you you see  
> You're the one who's  
> Trapped with me  
>  
> Cos you are in the earth of me  
> You are in the earth of me  
> My head's not yours it's mine  
> And I'll take my fucking time  
> Cos I know, I know, I know
