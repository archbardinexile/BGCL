title: The Six of Steel Originsâ€”Firien Part 1

---

Living in a desert oasis was not easy. One had to stay hydrated, keep the sun off one's scales, and work extra hard to nurture crops. That being said, Firien was probably amongst the happiest of the few villagers that had chosen to make a life here. Rather, had chosen to remain here. It was no secret that many villagers had succumbed to the allure of a more prosperous life on Caelum's Landing, and abandoned this ancient watering hole altogether. But if this place was good enough for their parents, it was good enough for them. It wasn't all bad. They didn't mind the heat, and they enjoyed working at their parents' bakery. They had made their name producing artisan pastries with the very spices that the oasis was famous for exporting. They even baked their goods with their own fiery breath. In fact, their bakery was one of the few businesses still flourishing in this increasingly desolate land. Today, Firien was to pay a visit to a friend on the far side of the watering hole, who supplied fresh wheat for the bakery.

Firien is a relatively common sight in Madanau, walking back and forth running errands for their parents and helping with whatever is needed. It is also because they are kind of hard to miss; a tall, broad-shouldered lean dragonborn, scaled a green-tinted brass with burnished shocks of rusty orange. Their impressive crest of horns catch the unforgiving sun in these wonderous colours as they walk across town. Despite its delapidated state, it is someone uncharitable to call Madanau a village; though a small town, it encompasses the entire circle around the body of water and the lush vegetation it begets, and if you want to get anywhere you either have to walk around, or take a canoe across. It's no small pond, that's for sure, but it's nonetheless a sleepy locale. Unless you're Firien Madizos, who always seems ready for the day. It's a shame really, to see Madanau reduced to its current state, given it's by all accounts, been here since the beginning. Some even say that Firien's family line came here along with the town; it would certainly explain why they like it so much.

There is a spring in Firien's step as the weather isn't so harsh today. They catch the attention of a few familiar faces as they walk the southern path around the oasis. Many made their houses on the shores and had constructed small jetties from which they could fish or launch their canoes. Madanau was never short of fish, for at the very bottom of the oasis lay a portal to the elemental plane of water. This was not uncommon among the known earthmotes, but none produced quite such gemstone aquamarine water as on Madanau. Firien receives a few waves from the local fishermen, and a nod from an old man in a rocking chair on his porch. Before long, Firien's friend's farmhouse comes into view. They knew to give a shout before knocking as their friend might be milling about the wheat field.

Firien looks around first. They don't see anyone, but still they take a deep breath and are sure to project their voice as much as they can.
"Hey buddy! You in or are you out!?"
They then proceed to walk up and knock on the door, just to cover all their bases.

The door opens and Firien is greeted by Lora, a buxom elf of middling age, and wife to his friend, Phinny. She carries their infant child in a papoose around her neck.
"Hey Firien, good to see you. Phinny is just checking on the wheat. Say hai, Kiho."
The elven child makes grabby hands at his mother's finger while staring at Firien.

"Hi, Lora. Hey there Kiho, you being good?"
Firien lowers their head slightly in an instinctive effort to appear smaller, looking down at the child with eyes that glimmer like fiery topazes. They smile.
"Understood, I'm in no rush. How's the day treating you?"

Kiho, as always, is completely fascinated by Firien's big orange face. The child reaches out to boop Firien's snoot briefly.
"Rather well, thank you. The last couple of days haven't been the right humidity for harvesting the wheat, but I suspect today..."
"Is that Firien?"
A pattering of footsteps and Phinny's head appears from around the back of the farmhouse.
"Firien! We've gotta do it now! Are you ready?"

"Whoa, someone's lit a fire under you today. Is everything good?"
Firien straightens up again and walks over to Phinny. At their full height, they are notably taller than their friends, and in addition to their horns they have a surprisingly strong presence for the child of bakers.

Even so, Phinny approaches the dragonborn as an old friend.
"Better than good! It's the perfect day for harvesting. Look!"
With a touch of magic, the sprightly elf scrunches up a head of wheat in his palms and makes what little moisture comes out float at his fingertip.
"I've been waiting for weeks to harvest this crop cause the humidity just hasn't been right. But now it's perfect. I want to do the whole lot! Are you up for it?"

"The whole lot?"
Firien turns to look at the field before them, and huffs in amusement.
"Well, looks like you have your work cut out for you. Fortunately, I don't have much else to do today. Where do we start?"

"Grab a scythe!"
Many of the farms on Madanau used traditional methods for harvesting and threshing. This was partly due to the expense and lack of available machines, but mostly because the local farmers enjoyed their work. In any case, farmers had to watch the yield of crops they were able to produce, lest their tax threshold rise with it. An increasingly hot topic on Caelum's Landing it seems. If you were fortunate enough to work on Phinny's farm, you could add a little extra magic to your work. The excitable elf had enchanted many of his tools himself. As Firien cut down the wheat, they found the grain separated itself from the straw and deposited itself magically in their bag. After an hour and several trips to empty their bags, Firien, Phinny, Lora and a couple of farm hands had created 10 neat rows of loose straw. They had completed a third of the crop. Phinny wipes his brow.
"Phew! How is everyone doing? Anyone need a break?"

"I'm feeling good, thank you."
The young dragonborn does not seem to be winded by their efforts. Perhaps it's because of their stature, or that they are just very well fitted to the otherwise harsh environment, but they seem right at home and content to continue their work. Indeed, Firien is often open to help others with their work no matter what, so long as they aren't busy. It's just as common to see them running errands or helping with their neighbours' labour as it is to see them helping out at the family bakery. The only place one would be hard-pressed to find Firien is the local Church of Caelum.

"Of course you are. Let me rephrase: I'm going to take a break, would anyone like a cold pineapple juice?"

"Well if there's cold pineapple juice on the table, I could take a quick break."

Firien turns to follow Phinny and Lora to the farm house, but pauses when they hear a rustling amongst the wheat. Looking around, they can see a small dimple in the wheat where a bird of some kind must have landed.

Firien stops and looks over. They squint at the area.
"Phinny? Have you been having any trouble with animals lately?"

Phinny pauses half way to the house.
"Animals? No more than usual. The scarecrows do their job."
A shiver makes its way up Firien's spine as they swear they hear the patch of wheat cackle.

Firien's grip on their scythe tightens, and their tail straightens curls into a tight anxious not behind them at the noise.
"There's something in the field. It doesn't sound friendly."

Phinny waves at the two farm hands to stop reaping. Lora, having not heard Firien, has stepped back inside to prepare the juice. Phinny and the farm hands remain quiet as they watch Firien inspect the patch of wheat. A wrinkled, bald, red scalp pops up above the wheat. Next, a pair of fiery eyes and a long hooked nose. A hellish imp launches into the air and, with a cackle, releases a firebolt into the wheat! Under the blazing sun, the dry wheat quickly catches fire, and a halo of flame rapidly begins to infest the crop.
"What the- oh shit! Honey!? Honey, get the hose!"
"What did you say, sweet- oh crap!"
Phinny scrambles toward the water pump while Lora unravels the hose. The imp beams smugly at Firien.

Firien grimaces in turn, and for a brief moment a flutter of flame can be seen between their teeth - but no, that'll only make the problem worse. Instead, they opt to just rush the creature, swinging upward with the scythe in their hand. Unfortunately, the imp keeps fluttering up higher as Firien tries to irritate the damn thing. But that's fine. So long as it's distracted.

Despite the long reach of the scythe, the imp remains just out of reach, cackling at Firien's attempts to cut it down. As the imp blows raspberries at the dragonborn, Phinny and Lora successfully connect up the hose, and the farmhands begin pumping. Phinny darts back over to where the flames spread and quells the flames he can by spraying the crop with water. The imp prepares another firebolt for the field.

"I don't think so."
This time, Firien hefts themself up with the power in their legs, and that power translates into their swing as the humble farming scythe becomes an instrument of doom, shearing straight through one of the imp's spindly wings and catching around its arm, bringing it down to the ground with a thud.

The imp's body crushes the wheat beneath it, and the fertile sand begins to soak up its blood. The next Firien looks over, Phinny has managed to douse the flames. A black, smoking circle remains, about 12 foot in diameter. The damage could have been a lot worse, all things considers. Phinny wipes his brow and puffs out his cheeks.
"Bloody hellspawn. You alright, Firien?"

Phinny looks over just in time to see Firien kicking the imp to make sure it's dead. Then they look over.
"Yeah, I'm fine. How's the damage?"

The imp already seems to be decomposing.
"Could have been worse. Maybe 20 gold's worth up in flame though."
Phinny approaches Firien to inspect the dead imp.
"Where in blazes did it come from?"

"That's a very good question. And probably something to ask the garrison."
Firien huffs, and takes a moment to tuck the pendant around their neck back into their shirt. They tilt their head and leer at the decomposing imp, nonetheless considering the question.

Imps were certainly not native to Madanau. Nor does Firien know of any earthmote that it could have come from. Firien looks up to the horizonâ€”or lack thereof. Madanau was situated very close to the miasma; the impenetrable fog that surrounded the known world. It was one of the reasons the denizens of Madanau were all too eager to find new homes elsewhere. A small fiend like this couldn't have found its way through the miasma on its own... could it? Just as they are thinking this, the fog shifts. Firien squints. Something was coming through, and at an alarming speed. A rogue earthmote, almost the size of the oasis, pushes through the abyss. The hunk of blackened rock seems to carry with it a swarm of ravensâ€”no, they were imps! It was on course to sail right over Madanau and drop a swarm of imps over the town.
"Good gods."
"Honey?"
A moment later, all three hear the bell of the town hall clang, signalling the emergency.

Firien wastes no time. Having not dropped the scythe they have claimed as a weapon, they place a hand to Phinny's back and start trying to hurry him along.
"To the shelters, let's hurry."
There's no reliable cover out here on the farms, they have to get further into the town to shelter in one of the safehouses.

Phinny reaches out to his wife who is still carrying Kiho. She tucks herself under Phinny's arm and the three run together toward the shelters. The nearest shelter was half a mile away on the outskirts of town. Lora was quickly tiring having to carry Kiho, but the three stuck together as best they could. As they enter town, they see other families leaving their homes and making their way to the southernmost shelter. Two clerics of Caelum usher people toward the shelter, urging them to remain calm and walk in an orderly queue. This proved to be difficult however, as hunks of rock and gravel were now falling on the oasis from above. A great splash rings out as a boulder crashes into the waters of the oasis not far from them. Firien looks up. The rogue earthmote was almost fully eclipsing Madanau now.
"This way! Stay calm, down the steps, that's it."
Cries ring out as another sizeable rock crashes into the sand very close to the queue.
"Look out!"
A swarm of imps were descending from above.
"Argh, Terrence! Wake up, man!"
"Ah! Right!"
The two clerics quickly come together. With a flourish of their hands, two beacons of light envelop the villagers closest to the shelter. Firien recognises the spell as magic circle. Above, the descending imps bounce off the luminous cylinders.
"Hurry! Inside!"
"Come on!"
With the two clerics concentrating on their spells, there is no one else around to help those villagers straggling outside the cylinders. The imps continue to descend.

The noise overhead is like thunder in Firien's brain, and they look up to see the earthmote bearing down on them, and the imps descent, and they grit their teeth. When the group reaches the cylinders, Firien pushes Phinny and Lora through... And turns right back around, passing up safety in favour of action. As they run back towards those who still need help, they block out the noise and fear and the voices of those behind them with a prayer, spoken quietly under their breath in draconic.
"Platinum Dragon, turn your cerulean eye to this humble town and grant us the means to keep ourselves and each other safe, to weather these trials with dignity, and to emerge strong and hopeful."
Firien looks around, combing through the chaos to hone in on those in need.

"Firien! What are you doing!?"
The wheat farmer tries to grab Firien's garment but he is not quick enough. He and Lora are swept into the queue of people waiting to enter the shelter.
"It's alright, love... they'll be alright."
Where Firien stands, they can see several families and villagers making a run for the cylinders. To Firien's left, two young lads skitter to a halt and dart back behind their cart when three armed imps make a beeline for them. One of the lads picks up a rake and starts swiping at the air. To Firien's right, five more imps are trying to smash through the cylinder with crude weapons. The people inside try to squash themselves against the far side of the cylinder to avoid the attacks. Behind the cylinder, Firien catches sight of a family of four, huddled together behind a hay bale. It was chaos. Firien had to summon all the willpower they could just to concentrate.

Firien takes note of each within the commotion, and judges the cylinder to be holding, and the family well-hidden enough to be, at least for now, safe. Thus, they turn their attention to the boys trying to defend themselves. Still with a bloodstained scythe in hand, Firien rushes over and swings upward, catching the the midsection of one imp and slicing through. As the blood falls, FIrien looks up to the other imps and a growl rumbles from their brassy throat. A dare, and most crucially of all, a distraction.

The imp clutches its open wound and its wings quickly atrophy, causing it to fall, dead. The first of the remaining two imps launches a firebolt at Firien. It glances off Firien's natural brass armour; barely a singe. The third imp Firien is not ready for. It clutches onto their back and tries to bite their neck. The second imp reacts and flutters in, trying to wrench the scythe from Firien's hands...

"Get off!"
Firien struggles to fight off the imp's attempt to disarm them given another one is desperately trying to find a soft part to bite, and instead they opt to use this as an opportunity and they shove the scythe forward. Hard. It skewers straight through the imp and they let it and the scythe embedded in its body fall to the ground, instead reaching back to grab the imp on their back. Their hands gain purchase on something, and they dig their claws into it as they yank it up and over their head to throw it across the street.

The imp tumbles through the air, flapping frantically to try and stay airborne. It crashes into the nearby cart and holds its head, dizzied. The two lads come out from behind the cart once again. The lad with the rake swings it into the imp's guts, finishing it off.
"Thank you!"
The pair run for the sanctuary of the cylinders. The queues of people are steadily declining now as more and more make their way into the shelter. Inside the cylinders, the villagers have passed around what tools they have to try and jab at the imps outside. Then, suddenly, one of the cylinders drops!
"Terrence!"
A hunk of rock had fallen from above and hit the young cleric over the head. He now lies unconscious by the entrance.
"Dammit. Caelum preserve us!"
Those inside the fallen cylinder try to flock toward the other, but there are far too many to fit inside the ten foot radius. Smelling fresh meat, the imps converge on the surrounded villagers. Firien sees six, no, eight... nine! Some kind villagers forgo their place in the queue to tend to Terrence and drag him into the shade.

Firien struggles to discern the utter chaos of the scene before them. Their mind races, and for a split second they are frozen with fear. What happens if everyone is unable to fight back? Can they last long enough for help to arrive? And then they remember the weight of the pendant against their chest. They thumb the humble wood and uncut gem for a moment, take a deep breath, and focus. Action could lead to death. Inaction ensures it. They look around for their scythe and see instead a maul that one of the many imps had dropped. A crude weapon, but far better than a farming tool, Firien grabs it and starts running towards the converging imps. They do not shout, or pray out loud, but with every step their mind races, Bahamut please this is the only thing I can think to do, I don't know if it's right but this is what I choose-
With a bellow of pure adrenaline, Firien puts their whole body into a swing at the descending flock of imps, and the course of their very life is changed with a clap of thunder.

Firien feels their maul connect with an imp's jaw and nearly leaps out of their scales when it is coupled with a reverberating clang. A flash of light fills Firien's vision. So bright that even when they shut their eyes the imprint of a bolt of lightning remains. Firien opens their eyes to find the imp at their feet, charred and twitching. They look up. Four more imps had been dealt the same blow and were now mere ashes amongst the sand. They had been struck by lightning! How was this possible? Firien looks up. A storm cloud looms overhead. It wasn't there before. Had they created it somehow? Had Bahamut heard them? Firien's scales tingle with electricity. They felt like they could do it again! They would have to. All the imps were now converging on them.
"Caelum's breath."

Firien's entire body feels like it's crackling. And for everyone else, because of course Firien can't see it themself, they are. Errant sparks of lightning jump distances between their brass scales, and the pendant around their neck now pulses pure platinum light. They look up at the descending imps, and they take a step back, but not in fear. Instead it is to lift their hand, up to the sky where storm clouds gather and imps imps chatter, and power grows in their palm. It's like they know exactly what to do.
"Kluuroki!"
The eardrums of everyone in a 300 foot radius pop at the thunderous boom that erupts from Firien's hand, a wave of power that catches every imp that draws close to them.

The imps closest to Firien are cast back into the air as if they were mere debris. Four of them fall unceremoniously back to the ground, their bones shattered. Two clutch their pierced eardrums and flee. Firien hasn't noticed that the world around them seems to have stopped. All of the villagers are staring, having completely forgotten about the shelter.
"What are you all standing around for? You never seen a dragonborn before? Go!"
The elder cleric can safely drop his cylinder and join the fray as the last of the villagers make their way inside. The number of imps appears to be dwindling, at least in this region. The rogue earthmote had now almost completely passed over Madanau and it was continuing toward Caelum's Landing. While the cleric picks off the smaller imps trying to nip at his heels, Firien has the attention of six more. They try to surround them from above and change tactics, opting to throw their weapons at the sparkling dragonborn.

Firien turns and sees the imps are trying to surround them, and they start to back up. And as they do their eyes are drawn up to the storm cloud in the sky. It's calling to them, Firien can feel it. And held high once more, they oblige.
"Irtipro."
They pull down from the sky another bolt of lightning, and the imps forming in front of them are caught in its blast!

Another crack of thunder and a blinding flash of light! In moments, every last imp is reduced to dust. And this time it was effortless. Firien had heard tales of mages calling lightning, but never imagined they would have this power at their fingertips. Firien examines their surroundings. Most of the villagers had now successfully entered the shelter and were no longer under threat. They see the old cleric, beating away the last of the imps with his mace. They spy a few more imps fluttering out of their hiding spots, now drawn back toward the rogue earthmote. In the distance, pillars of smoke were rising from where imps had set fires. The ground was littered with debris fallen from the earthmote. There remained distant sounds of panic further into town, but at least everyone here was safe now.
"Hey you there!"
The cleric waves Firien down. But both are interrupted by a surge of light in the sky. It was the earthmote! A city-sized golden shield of energy was blocking the earthmote's advance.
"About bloody time!"

Firien jumps slightly at the sound, for they know it doesn't come from them. But then they look up, and relax a little; help has arrived. With that bolstering their resolve, Firien walks over to the old cleric.
"What do we do now?"
If they've noticed, it's unclear, but Firien is still sparking with divine power, it skitters across their scales and fills each word with thunderous presence even when they speak normally. The pendant around their neck still hums faintly, clearly adorned as their idol, the font of their magic; a dragon's claw of polished wood holding an uncut white quartz.

Satisfied they are safe, the cleric too approaches Firien.
"We get over there and help put out those fires. We won't get rid of the imps that easily."
The cleric's attention is on the chaos in the distance until he turns to address the matter of the strange dragonborn.
"I don't know who you are, friend. But I could sure use your help- no, hang on... I do know you... aren't you the baker's kid?"

Firien stops and blinks.
"Uh y-yeah that's me o>"

"Hah! You know you aren't bad in a fight. Perks of being a dragonborn, ay?"
It takes Firien a moment to comprehend the cleric's reply. Had he just mistaken them for a bronze dragonborn? Even so, the greying dwarf obviously didn't know much about their species. A bronze dragonborn could indeed breathe lightning, but summon storms? Cast thunderwave? Impossible.
"What's your name, son?"

Firien looks down at the dwarf and tilts their head slightly. They haven't been attending church for a while now, so they honestly can't say for sure who this man is. Is he new? They suppose it doesn't matter now.
"Firien, sir. Firien Madizos."

"Firien, ay? Name's Stoutmann. You still feel like you've got some fight in you?"

Firien takes a moment to look around, they can see smoke in the distance and hear chaos on the wind. With a tap to their pendant, they nod.
"If there's still a fight to be had, I can't back down."

"Good man."
The dwarf claps his hand to Firien's arm. Apparently he hadn't yet noticed the dragonborn's curious pendant.
"Let's get Terrence on his feet first. Can't let the kid sleep on the job."

Firien nods, and walks over to the other cleric. As they kneel down, they see the wound on the young man's head, and once again Firien feels a tug. Inherent understanding fills them as they reach out and gently touch their fingertips to Terrence's temple.
"Seisu."
Shimmery, faintly bluish platinum light pours from Firien's hand, seeping into the younger cleric's head wound, and indeed rolling down his body to his other injuries in a silvery fog. Even if not too observant this magic is easily recognised by an experienced cleric like Stoutmann; Cure Wounds.

The villagers taking care of Terrence step away as Firien approaches. At first, Stoutmann thinks the dragonborn is simply assessing Terrence's wound. But when he sees the light from Firien's hand wash over his protege, he kneels down to snatch Firien's hand away. Fortunately, Firien's spell had already concluded, and young Terrence begins to stir.
"What did you just do?"
"Ugh, my head."

Firien does not answer immediately, and has perhaps missed the question entirely as they are instead looking at their own hand as the platinum shimmer leaves it, finally becoming fully aware of the power that suffuses them. Then they look down, and their first instinct is to check on Terrence.
"Are you alright? You got hit pretty bad."

Stout tentatively releases Firien's wrist, apparently content to let the matter go for now.
"I did?"
"You took a hunk of rock to the head, sonâ€”you blacked out."
"I- I don't even remember- is everyone safe?"
"Yes, thanks to Firien here."
The human looks up at Firien with sleepy brown eyes.
"Hey err... thanks for helping us."

Firien pauses a moment, then nods, but their face is a little grim.
"Don't thank me yet, there's still a lot of chaos further up the street. Can you stand?"

"I- I think so."
The two help Terrence back to his feet. He stumbles momentarily as the blood rushes from his head, but grips Firien's shoulder to stay upright. Before they can celebrate, another massive crunch echoes from above them. Their eyes are drawn once again to the rogue earthmote. The golden shield that brought the black rock to a stop in mid air begins to pulse and grow. Slowly but surely, the earthmote begins to once again gain momentum, this time heading back toward the miasma. Firien can also make out distant flashes of lightning on the surface of the earthmote. It must be the clerics of Caelum battling the imps. As for what was creating the shield, Firien couldn't make it out.

Firien has heard tales of a sect of monks within the Church of Caelum, with a very specialised set of skills. These monks train relentlessly so that they may have the power to move the earth. The monks of the Spirit Temple are tasked with protecting Caelum's Landing from the collision of rogue earthmotes, just like the one they gaze upon now. The power Firien witnesses is truly astonishing. As the earthmote moves closer, Firien can just about see the winged monks stationed at strategic points, channelling their ki into the shield.

"Whoa."
Firien is struck a little dumb at first. They know about this, everyone does, but they've never seen it before. It honestly beggers belief a little. Then they remember the chaos that's been wrought from all this, and look back to their unlikely comrades.
"Where to next?"

"We must go to the church, report to the Prefect that the townsfolk here are safe. It is important that our efforts to combat this crisis match our peers."
"He means we need to get organised."
"I see that rock didn't hit you too hard, boy. You go on ahead, Terrence. I want to speak with Firien."
"Yes, Chaplain. Sorry, Chaplain."
Terry heads up the road in the direction of the nearest column of smoke. Stoutmann turns his attention to Firien now.
"How did you do that just now? That was divine magic you used to heal Terrence."

Firien is silent for a moment, their scaly brow furrowing. They grasp their pendant for support.
"I- I'm not sure. I was holding a prayer in my mind, to keep myself calm and grounded and then... Well. All this happened."

Stoutmann's eyes widen.
"By my beard! Your prayers were answered... There can be no other explanation. Hah! Caelum has blessed you in your time of need."
Stoutmann claps his hands to both of Firien's arms and he shakes the poor dragonborn with some vigour.

It's something of a feat for anyone to be able to jostle Firien like this, and it makes them hold their arms out to keep themself steady, and their pendant thuds against their chest. They eventually put their hands on Stoutmann's shoulders to calm him.
"Yeah- yeah about that-"
Their eyes catch the smoke on the horizon, and they sigh.
"... Now is not the time for this conversation. There's still work to be done."

"Right you are, son. With Caelum at our backs we will prevail."
The pair quickly catch up to Terrence who is helping a group of villagers shovel sand onto a burning cart of straw. They seem to have this well in hand as the smoke blackens from lack of air. Up ahead, they see this district's church; the one Chaplain Stoutmann is in charge of. A third cleric and a group of villagers appear to have barred the doors to the church from the outside. They are pushing their backs hard against the doors as crashing echoes from inside.
"Over there. Talia!"
"Chaplain!"
"What's the situation?"
"We've managed to trap a bunch of imps inside. There's also a... w- well it's bigger than an imp."

"How much bigger?"
Though they ask the question, Firien's eyes are on the chapel. It's all well and good to bar the door, but if whatever is inside is bigger than an imp, it might get bored, might try to come through a window, or some other weak spot. It's not like they're going to care about the sacredness of the structure.

Talia holds out a downturned palm just below shoulder height.
"About this much. This one doesn't have wings, it's got two massive horns and these creepy, spherical, black eyes."
Talia reasserts her shoulders against the door. Firien takes a moment to create the image in their mind. Could it be a quasit Talia is describing? If they recall correctly, they are related to imps.
"Well we can't keep them in there forever. We must prepare a plan of attack."

Firien wrinkles their snout a little bit, trying to think.
"They're right behind the door? Hmmm... Maybe I could do what I did last time and blow them back. I'll stay standing here."
They position themselves right in front of the door.
"And the moment the doors open I'll do my thing, and you can close in on them while they're blown back. We can't let them spill out onto the streets."

Stout's eyes brighten. He slaps Firien on the arm again.
"Good shout, son."
"I'm sorry, what are you going to do?"
"You ever seen a dragon's breath, Talia? Terrence! Get over here!"
Young Terry comes running.
"How many are in there?"
"Six imps plus the big one."
"Reckon you can manage that, son?"
Stout looks up to Firien as Terry takes the place of the villagers barring the doors. The villagers run for cover and Terry and Talia prepare to open the doors on command.

Firien gives Stoutmann a side-eye.
"You know I'm a brass dragonborn, right?"
They look back towards the door, take a deep breath, and holds out their hands.
"I'm ready... Now!"
The moment the doors open, Firien brings their hands apart, then claps them together, and the power yields to them once more.
"Kluuroki!"
The draconic pulls from the sky another thunderous boom as the divine wave erupts through the entrance to the chapel.

Firien barely has time to set eyes on the fiends before they are cast back into the chapel like nought but debris. Firien swears he hears bones crack as four of the six imps are pulverised by the thunderwave and instantly killed. Their bodies roll across the chapel floor. Two imps and the now angered quasit weather the storm but clutch at their ears, having taken a lot of damage.
"Bloody hells!"
"Don't let them escape!"
Talia and Terrence are the first to move in. Talia slams her mace into the wounded imp, turning its skull to jelly. Terrence brings down his club only for the deafened imp to desperately dodge and flee into the chapel. The quasit turns its eyes on Firien and charges with its enormous horns lowered!

Firien does their best to try and prevent the rush, but the horns brush straight past their clumsy block and the horn skims painfully skims the scales in their side and they yelp. There's a faint burning sensation tickling the edges, but doesn't manage to seep past their natural plating... And then something thrums inside their chest. A righteous rage that seeks to rebuke this aggression, and with a growl they push against the quasit. There is another boom as the creature's body is rocked by thunderous force, divine platinum shimmer and dolorous pain in and around its skull. It gives Firien a moment to step back and breathe. Firien uses the momentary breather to wind their arm back, and they bring it round to strike quasit with their looted mace. It connects! Thudding against its chest.

The quasit stands no chance in its current state. Firien's mace snaps the creature's sternum and it is thrown back from the sheer force of Firien's blow. Dead.
"Firien! Are you alright? Let me heal your wounds... vis medicatrix."
A quick healing word and an open palm from Stoutmann is enough to seal Firien's wounds. Thankfully they were able to shrug off the quasit's poison. The pair hear a smash as the last remaining imp attempts to flee through a stained glass window.
"Terrence! Get after it."
"Yes chaplain!"
The young lad gives chase to the wounded imp while his elven colleague approaches Firien.
"You're a tempest cleric?"

Firien looks up to Talia and, finally breaks out into a strained smile as it seems like someone might finally know what's going on.
"I... I feel like there's a storm raging under my skin and the hammer of thunder in my chest, does that sound about right?"
They instinctively bring their hand to their pendant as they say this, to stop it thumping against their chest in time with their wild heart rate.

"I'm afraid I wouldn't know. We are all light domain clerics. But... I have seen what tempests can do in battle. It looks a lot like what you just did."
"Oh, I thought the lightning was a dragonborn thing."
"You're thinking of bronze dragonborn, Chaplain. Our friend here is a brass dragonborn. They breathe fire."
"Fire? Then everything you just did... calling the lightning... Hah! Truly astonishing the power Caelum has blessed upon you. Your destiny must be one of great import, my friend."

Firien stares at Stoutmann, and their jaw tightens a little. They look around, and in the quiet of the moment, they find they can no longer keep up the lie of omission.
"I don't worship Caelum. But that isn't important right now, what is important is what we do next. Where do we move on to?"

"You- you don't? But then..."
Firien can practically see the poor man's enthusiasm leaving his body. Perhaps after such long service to the church he thought he had finally seen the intervention of Caelum himself. But it wasn't to be. The greying dwarf grumbles.
"You're right. We continue to the church and report to the prefect."
"I'll go get Terry."
"I want you to stay close to me, son. You may not worship Caelum, but the Church can at least prepare you for what to expect... You've been given a great gift, it's important you know how to use it."

Firien nods.
"Let's not waste any time, then."
As everyone starts walking, Firien pouts to themself a little. Bahamut doesn't put too much stock in words, but Caelum does, and they feel like they should at least say something to give the old dwarf something to embolden him. Resolved, they gently pat the man's shoulder.
"Your god and mine. With Caelum and Bahamut with us, together, we'll see this through in no time."

Stoutmann raises his head, apparently in realisation. He looks over the young dragonborn with narrowed eyes and offers an appreciative nod.
"You have wisdom beyond your years, son."
The dwarf briefly removes his helmet to wipe his forehead, revealing a shining bald patch on his crown. A shadow suddenly washes over them. The clerics look up to find the rogue earthmote and its fiendish denizens now completely enveloped in a golden bubble. It was passing over their heads once more, back toward the Miasma. Firien can get a good look at the source of the golden energy now. Several tens of monks, some winged, some on gliders, act as the vertices of the woven sphere that pushes the earthmote back. On the earthmote itself, Firien can now clearly see the clerics of Caelum battling the swarms of fiends. Lightning was raining down from above them, thunder blasting from their gauntlets. These must be the tempest clerics Talia spoke of; the foot soldiers of the Church.

It's quite a walk to the city district, on the eastern side of the Oasis. Thankfully it is largely uneventful. They arrive to find villagers banding together to repair broken housing and sweeping up debris on the streets. Outside the main church, a pagoda has been erected as a shelter for the numerous wounded.

"There's the Prefect! Come on."
Stoutmann breaks into a jog and the others follow. Though Firien had never been formally introduced to the Prefect, their reputation preceded them. They were a tall, slender aasimar with a complexion like the finest milk chocolate. Their straight white hair was brushed back and held in a ponytail by a simple blue ribbon. The flowing robes they wore were also very simple, belying their status as Prefect.
"Prefect!"
The Prefect turns from supervising a healing taking place. Their eyes were icy blue and glowed like the brightest stars. Yet they remained half-lidded as if they were perpetually sleepy.
"Stoutmann. I'm glad to see you're alright."
"I have a report for you, ma'am."
"Proceed."
As Stoutmann delivers his report, Firien's eyes are drawn to the marking on the Prefect's forehead. A halo. A simple glowing white ring perhaps the size of a plum. The mark was unmistakable. This halo was commonly associated with the Sol Orbis family; the ruling family of Caelum's Landing and heirs to Caelum himself.
"I see. You have done very well, Stoutmann. Thank you. You and your acolytes please report to Kaley inside, she is overseeing the healing effort here."
"Yes ma'am. I would ask that Firien join us too, ma'am."
The Prefect's eyes turn on Firien.
"Is what Stoutmann said about you true?"

Firien instinctively straightens up as they are brought under scrutiny. There is an overbearing anxiety pressing on their shoulders all of a sudden; as if confirming the truth to the Prefect will suddenly make all of this real. Along with any consequences it might bring. But they swallow the lump in their throat and square their shoulders, turning their tension into confidence. They meet the Prefect's gaze, and it can be seen that, instead of a flicker of flame at the edges of their yellow eyes, like many dragonborn, there is a skitter of lightning.
"It's true, Prefect."

The Prefect is silent for a moment, staring into Firien's eyes as if assessing their sincerity. They nod subtly.
"Go inside, Stoutmann. Firien will join you in a moment."
"Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am."
"And please don't call me "ma'am."
"Sorry m- err... Prefect. Come on you two."
Before they head inside, Stoutmann offers Firien a nod of reassurance.
"How do you feel? Firien, wasn't it?"

"Ah- yes, Firien Madizos... A little overwhelmed, to be honest. I feel like there's lightning beneath my scales, a-and I'm worried about my parents but..."
They take a deep breath, to prevent themself from rambling, and they follow the thrum of thunder in their chest to centre their nerves, and it seems to relax them.
"But... I'm not quite as scared as I thought I'd be. Well- more like my fear is... Tempered, by what needs to be done."

The Prefect nods subtly once more.
"I will have an acolyte sent to check on your parents, and deliver the news that you are okay. Would you walk with me a moment?"

Despite the brave front they're putting up, Firien does visibly relax.
"Thank you, Prefect."
They fall into step with the Aasimar, doing their best to match the pace the Prefect sets despite Firien being quite tall.

The Prefect leads Firien away from the bustle of the pagoda and onto a quieter street where they can remain in the shade of the Church.
"The Platinum Dragon does not commonly bless his followers with divine magics such as those you displayed today. But I have learned that he is a compassionate soul. A just soul. I can only assume that your faith in him found his ears in a moment of dire need."

As Firien follows, they allow themself to think on what the Prefect is saying, and they try to formulate in their mind an explanation, or even just a feeling.
"Bahamut doesn't really attach himself to words or objects. I put my faith in him into my everyday deeds; the work I do at home, the ways I can help my neighbours. When the imps started swarming... Well, it was no question. I had to do something."

The Prefect pauses and turns to Firien, offering the subtlest of smiles.
"Encouraging words. I would hope that your heart remains so kind and humble as you acclimate to your newfound power... and responsibility."
They continue walking.
"In circumstances such as this it is protocol that the Church offer tutelage to help you understand and hone your skills as a cleric. I would understand should you wish to refuse, but I urge you not to. You... may find yourself under the Church's scrutiny."

Firien nods in understanding.
"I... I don't want to be alone in this. It feels right, but that doesn't mean it isn't also terrifying."

"Thank you for your honesty. You should speak with your parents about all this, of course. When you're ready, I will submit a request for you to attend the Church on Caelum's Landing as an acolyte. And... I will of course stress that your faith lies with Bahamut. If there's anything you need, you can come to see me."

With a deep breath that seems to relieve their body of no small amount of tension, Firien looks at the Aasimar with an expression that betrays both their youth and their emotions.
"Thank you, Prefect. I would... Like to help still, if you'll permit it. The strength, the healing... It's felt intuitive so far."

"If you feel you can, that would be appreciated. Go and speak with Stoutmann, I'm sure he'll have some jobs for you. My name is Sana, by the way."

A young acolyte runs through the streets of Madanau with butterflies in his stomach. Thankfully not literally. It wasn't uncommon for the young earth genasi to attract butterflies with the vibrant flowers peeking out of his short, spiked hair. The damage was severe in places, but thankfully not widespread. The all clear bell had been sounded and the citizens had left the shelters to begin repairs. It was encouraging to see such mechanical teamwork from Madanau's community. And it was a pillar of that community the young acolyte was trying to find.

While the absolute worst is over, things are still chaotic in places, though mitigated by the people banding together to start the arduous task of cleaning up. And it is as the young acolyte is observing the joint effort that he finally spots something that might be what he's looking for.
"Is that all of them?"
"It is, Miss Bixi. At least all the bits that weren't smashed."
"Oh don't worry, it should be more than enough. Now..."
The dramatic green glint is the first thing that catches the genasi's eye, and it comes from the centre plating of this dragonborn's crest. She steps back from the broken down wall of a house the locals have done their best to reconstruct, and brings her hands up. She's wearing what look like simple, comfortable robes with... A frilly white apron over the top?
"Inhelk Slemon."
Vibrant orange magics start to sprout from the spaces between the reconstructed stonework, shaping the stone back into the wall it once was. This is powerful transmutation magic.

"Here you are, my love."
Another brass dragonborn, heavier set with a handsome jawline and chamfered crest, wheels a barrow of replacement stones to his partner.

"Ah, Thank you Lorento. Just set them there my love, the others can start putting them where they're needed."
"Ah, excuse me?"
As the genasi acolyte approaches, Bixi snaps her fingers, and the wall solidifies. It's almost like it never got knocked down. She then turns to the genasi, her deep reddish snout glinting a little as she smiles.
"Ah, hello, do you need any help?"

"You are erm... Bixi and Lorento Madizos, right? Parents of Firien?"
"Firien? Are they alright?"
"Y-yes. Well erm... sort of. They're at the church. They're unharmed but... something has happened that the Prefect would like to speak with you about."

"The Prefect?"
Bixi stands up straight, and her tail straightens behind her in alarm. It only takes a moment before she turns around, points the people stacking stones to the work they need to be doing, then turns right back around.
"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!"

---

Firien seems... In a surprisingly good mood, actually. With some direction from Stoutmann, they have been flitting about the church, helping where they are asked, usually through practical means as they only have a small amount of magic to spare. But that doesn't mean that there isn't some healing to be done.
"Winida."
With a gentle word, a shimmer of platinum weaves its way through torn fabric and loose seams, pulling thread back into place and buttons back into line. The shimmer fades with a puff, and Firien hands the teddy bear back to the child in front of them.
"There we are, all better again."

The young blue tiefling snatches her horned teddy bear back up and squeezes it tight.
"What do you say, Tilly?"
"Thank you!"
"Good girl. Thank you."
"Can I touch your nose?"
"Tilly..."

"Haha I don't mind."
Firien kneels down so the little girl can reach them. It makes the orange tips of their impressive crown of horns glint in the light coming through the windows.

The little tiefling reaches out a stubby hand to gently stroke Firien's snout. She giggles.
"It feels nice!"
Embarrassed, she snatches her hand away and wiggles, burying her face in her teddy.
"Doctor!"
Firien looks to the entrance of the church where two villagers are carrying another between them. Kaley, the local dwarf surgeon leading the healing effort, rushes up to them.
"What happened?"
"Bunch of imps got into the generator, blew it apart."
"He's bleeding a lot."
"Any free hands get me a stretcher, bring him inside."

Firien looks up, hears what's happening, and with one last reassuring smile to the girl they stand and start to move. They join the effort to pick up a stretcher and make their way over to Kaley.

They find themselves looking across the stretcher to Terry, lifting it from the other side. He offers a shy half-smile of recognition. Kaley and the villager help the engineer onto the stretcher and the four carry him inside.
"Set him down here."
Kaley directs them to a mattress on the marble floor. It was easier for the dwarf to get at her patient from here.
"Help me cut away his clothes."
Terry fetches a pair of scissors and Kaley cuts away the bloodstained fabric. The engineer was peppered with tiny lacerations across his right side.
"Ahh Moradin. Alright we can't seal the wounds until we know if there's any shrapnel left inside."
Firien feels something very strange. A tingling in their fingers. There were indeed metal shards in the man's body. The electricity still dancing over Firien's scales was tugging at them. To find out exactly how deep the shards of metal were, all they would have to do is run their hand over the engineer's chest.
"How big was the blast?"
"Pretty big. Thankfully we dodged the bulk of it."

The sensation makes Firien stiffen up for a moment, but once they focus on it and try to understand its meaning, they relax again. Knowing hesitation isn't an option, Firien steps over and kneels in a space next to both the surgeon and her patient.
"I can sense the metal. I could pinpoint them, if I may come closer?"
Firien holds their hand out to demonstrate to Kaley the faint sparks of electricity harmlessly bouncing between their scales.

Kaley cocks an eyebrow. Her eyes dart between Firien and the sparks at their fingertips.
"Alright kid, knock yourself out."
Floating their hand gently over the man's torso, Firien feels what they would imagine it feels like to have their hairs stand on end. Their scales bristle when their palm finds shards of metal close to the skin. They could find four shards in total, one a little deeper than the others. Then, a clink!
"Something nipped me!"
Kaley looks a little closer at Firien's hand. One of the shards had magnetically attached itself to Firien's palm.

"Hah! You're a walking magnet. Terry, get me some tweezers would you?"
Terry quickly returns with a pair of metal tweezers and hands them to Kaley, who promptly hands them to Firien.
"Alright, kid... this is gonna be easier if you do it. Keep the tweezers closed when you go in, and just let your erm... natural magnetism do the rest."

They blink slightly as they accept the tweezers.
"Uh- right, I got this."
To Firien's credit, they are very careful. To keep their hand calm and steady, they try to think of it not as sticking pokey bits into a person, and more like... Precision decoration of a cake. A careful, exacting process they have done time and time again. This keeps them focused as the next two shards come out with startling ease. They pull away each time, remove the shard from their scales, and lean back over. When they lean over the third time, they take a deep breath.
"Alright... There's one left, but it's a little deeper than the others."

"You've got this, Firien."
With the practised skill of a cake decorator, Firien slowly but surely lowers the tweezers into the wound. After what feels like the longest eight seconds in Firien's life, they feel a snap as the shard magnetically attaches to the tweezers. With the same steady hand motions, Firien eases the tweezers out of the wound, and the shrapnel comes away with only a minor hiss from the engineer.
"Excellent work, kid. Alright Terry, go ahead."
With a nod, the young acolyte's hands glow with light, and the engineer's wounds quickly heal over.
"Not bad for a baker."

"Haha I mean, baking can be very delicate business."
Firien sets the tweezers down and accepts the opportunity to clean their hands when it is offered. They breathe a quiet sigh of relief to themself.

"You know, I just realised we've never been formally introduced. Name's Kaley Coldhands, I work with your parents at the Civic."
Kaley offers what is indeed a cold hand to shake.

By contrast, Firien's hand is hot to the touch, not uncomfortably so, but definitely hotter than even when Kaley has shaken their parents' hands in the past.
"Oh, really? I don't tend to ask about their Civic work. Not unless they want to talk about it themselves."

"It's nothing glamorous... tax rates, work shifts, best time for selling buns, that sort of thing."
"Firien!"
Stoutmann appears at the doors.
"Your folks have arrived."
"Huh, speak of the devil."

"Oh! Already?"
Firien straightens up with but a slight stumble, and follows back out the doors. Outside, Bixi takes a deep inhale, and she shivers slightly.
"I smell magical lightning alright. It kinda leaves behind a vibration in the air... makes my teeth feel funny-"
"Mum, dad!"
"Ooh there's my baby!"
It takes all of a second for Bixi to immediately steal Firien for a big squish around their midsection the moment they're in reach, and Firien nearly topples over from the momentum. Evidently they take after their father in terms of height.
"Haha I'm okay!"

"Woah! Ease up, love, you're going to break the kid."
Lorento joins the two, placing a large hand on both their backs, keeping them close.
"How you feeling, Yrevi?"

Bixi is content to stay squishing, but loosens up a little bit. Firien looks up to their dad with a smile.
"I'm okay, I really am. A little overwhelmed. How... How much have you been told?"

"This young lad told us you'd started shooting lightning out your hands. That the clerics think that you-"
Their father's eyes flash down to the pendant around their neck.
"That you've been gifted divine power."

Firien catches this, and with a gentle hand on her shoulder, they step back from Bixi. They take hold of the pendant and look up to the sky, and though the storm cloud is no longer there, they can still feel the electric shadow of its presence.
"I know how it sounds... But it's true. It's the only explanation, I- I pulled lightning from the sky, and healed a man's wounds, all on instinct. I was... I was heard."
As they curl their hand around their pendant, a skitter of lightning jumps between the scales of their fingers, and Bixi tilts her head. She brings her hand to wrap around Firien's in turn, closing her eyes and feeling... Then she opens them again and grins.
"I feel it. I can feel the magic making currents in your very beingâ€”but it's not like mine, it's not arcane."

"Divine magic."
Lorento shakes his head in disbelief.
"Firien, this is wonderful! Bahamut actually heard you."
The young earth genasi scampers away to go and find the Prefect.

"Hah! No wonder my arcane lessons didn't take! It was the universe saying back off, this one's meant for greater things!"
Bixi reaches up to squish Firien's cheeks.

"So... what happens now?"
"Firien has a choice to make, Mister Madizos."
The three turn to see the Prefect approaching, their floral assistant in tow.
"It's good to meet you both. Would you allow me a moment of your time?"

All eyes turn to Sana, and Bixi's go a little wide... But then she and Lorento see Firien smile a little at the Prefect's arrival. They look at their parents and nod.
"Of course, Prefect."

Sana bows their head a little in respect.
"Thank you. We can speak in my study."
Sana leads the trio into the Church and through to one of the private chambers. Inside is a cosy library, complete with padded armchairs, stationery, and even a layered glass map of Fio. The window is the only wall that doesn't have a bookshelf.
"Please, take a seat. Would you like anything to drink? Tea perhaps?"

As they wander inside, Bixi immediately starts to look around with energy.
"So many books!"
"I would like a cup of tea. It might calm nerves a bit more."

"That's very kind, thank you."
Lorento gives Bixi a subtle elbow. Sana nods.
"Halli?"
"I'm on it!"
With a tip of the flowers, the earth genasi wanders off to the kitchens. Sana settles in their chair opposite the dragonborn.
"I realise this must have come as quite a shock for all of you, and you must take some time to think on my proposal of course. The Church would like to offer Firien the training they need to become a tempest Cleric. They would be required to attend the Church on Caelum's Landing as a... provisional acolyte. They would be given adequate accommodation and, most importantly, they would be in an environment where they could worship Bahamut openly."
