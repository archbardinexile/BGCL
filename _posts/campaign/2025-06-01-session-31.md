title: Session 31 The Inquisition
---

Investigating the earthmote, **Gomruss** discovers two intact scrolls in the armoury: ***compelled duel*** and ***earth tremor***. At his side, **Blythe** brushes away the rubble to reveal a set of ancient light armour of Antiquan origin. She stuffs it into her bag of holdingâ€”perhaps it was worth something. **Guy** rummages through the dilapidated furniture in the stilt house, collecting a small pouch of gold coins. He admires the expert craftsmanship of the rug beneath his feet, which he recognises as characteristic of mid-700s *Primal Antiqua*. Outside, **Firien** and **Bantonio** discover the basilisk's victims. Hundreds of shattered statues litter the lakebed.

Firien spots an intact statue and summons Gomruss to perform an adjust density spell. The statue begins to float as **Arti** lowers an improvised grappling hook. Together, he and *Doom* manage to heave the statue onto the pontoon. The statue is frozen in a moment of shock. She wears the same ancient armour that Blythe discovered. Without the equipment they need to collect and distil the basilisk venom, the *Six of Steel* decide to hand over retrieval of the statue to the Commission. They mark the earthmote's location and course on Doom's map before returning to *Crowswood Place*.

### Crowswood Place

While Guy supervises the furnishing of the earthmote, Firien and Gomruss meet with Doom to begin extraction of the basilisk venom. Gomruss soothes his new serpentine companion while Doom and Firien hold the flasks to its fangs. Gomruss spends three charges of his basilisk die, earning him 20 flasks of basilisk venom. Firien considers how they might track the container's location. Gomruss advises that the distance would be too great for magic to work. Arti suggests the Commission send a scout instead.

## **996, Roscidas 25th**

Guy caresses the earthmote's helm as *Tuperk*'s engineers finish installing the cannon. She was finally sky-worthy! *Droleg* offers a bottle of sparkling wine to bless the earthmote. The Crows applaud as the Six of Steel name their new ship the *Verity*. Captain Brush calls for a test flight, naming Gomruss his boatswain. The dragonborn echoes Guy's orders with piercing volume as the mainsail catches the wind. The Verity sets sail to thunderous applause! Firien beams as they watch the iridescent clouds swirl in their wake. At the bow, Bantonio tears up at the sensation of flying as he raises his arms like wings.

Tacking into the wind, Blythe spots a small earthmote the crew might use for target practice. On Guy's orders, Arti loads the cannon while Bantonio lines up the shot. The explosion pops Bantonio's ears but a direct hit shatters the earthmote! Next, Firien suggests they test the Verity's speed. Their talons prickle with divine magic as they summon a gust of wind to propel the earthmote. The thrusters activate in unison, bringing the Verity up to a speed of 34 knots. Upon disembarking, the crew lift Guy into the air and sing three cheers!
