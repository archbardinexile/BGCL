title: Session 52 The Brush-Off
---

When **Firien** offers to assist with *Durzus*' investigation, the triton recommends they hitch a ride aboard the *Marley*, a *Free Trade Navy* ship due to return from *Runnelstone* with refugees. **Guy**, listening at the door, gulps. Watching the crew of the Marley disembark, Guy begins rehearsing his long-awaited reunion with Captain *Elyse Trelawney*. Focused on corralling the refugees, Elyse doesn't notice Guy until he calls her name. Training her large brown eyes on her wayward husband, Elyse marches toward Guy.

Without hesitation, Elyse slaps Guy across the face, berating him for his macabre and enigmatic letter. Guy hangs his head in resignation before delivering a sincere explanation. The *Six of Steel* support Guy, commending his performance and valour aboard the *Verity*. Elyse flutters her lashes in disbelief. Not only had her husband helped change the world, but he had finally found an honest job! Eventually, Elyse relents and invites the Six of Steel aboard the Marley to discuss the situation.

In her typical efficient fashion, Elyse presents her timeline of events.
