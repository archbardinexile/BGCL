A letter found in Grand Herald Patrocinor Mors' office at the Oratory and copied by Blythe. The blue wax seal bears the sigil of the Inquisition, marking it as secret information. The letter remains unburned despite the Grand Inquisitor's request.

You are hereby required to dismiss in disgrace Berevan from your service immediately and without prejudice, whereupon he will surrender to an Inquisitor at the Oratory for interrogation. Failure to comply within three days of receiving this letter, whether on the part of Berevan or yourself, will result in severe disciplinary action.

> The contents of this letter are SECRET and must not be copied or shared with anyone. To do so would jeopardise national security and result in severe disciplinary action for any parties involved. It is imperative you burn this letter as soon as you have read and understood the instructions within.
