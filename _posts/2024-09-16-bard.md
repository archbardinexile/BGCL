# Bard College

### College of Retainers

The College of Retainers

##### **Bonus Proficiencies**

When you join the College of Retainers at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with 1 weapon and: (a) 2 skills, (b) 2 tools, (c) 1 skill and 1 tool of your choice.

##### **Teaching Method**

Starting at 3rd level, you can choose a willing creature to become your ***ward***. You can only have one ward at a time and you must finish a long rest before you can choose a new ward. While your ward is within 60 feet of you, it gains benefits according to a ***teaching method*** of your choice. Changing your teaching methods requires you to spend a short rest during which you might evaluate your ward's performance or establish a new curriculum.

- **Discipline.** When your ward fails a saving throw while it has a Bardic Inspiration die, you can re-roll the die and must use the new roll.
- **Memorisation.** When your ward repeats an attack roll it made on a previous turn, it does so with advantage.
- **Flexibility.** Your ward can add half its proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes that doesn't already include its proficiency bonus, provided you have that proficiency.
- **Engagement.** Your ward's proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes while it as a Bardic Inspiration die.

##### **Legal Guardian**

##### **Master of Etiquette**
