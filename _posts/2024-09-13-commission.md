title: The Commission
---

The Commission for the Research of Offshore Worlds, affectionately called Crows, was founded by [Glimback Toestubber](commission#glimback-toestubber) in [899 PO](timeline#899-po). Originally known as the *Explorer's Guild*, Crows has since secured government funding and its members now work to catalogue the many beasts of the [Relief](getting-started#the-relief), research new magic, and prospect new [earthmotes](exploration#earthmotes) for colonisation. They operate out of [Crowswood Place](profundus#crowswood-place) on Fundus.

### Notable Members

##### **Glimback Toestubber**

- **Race:** Gnome, Male
- **Born:** 716 PO, Ingenium
- **Roles:** Founder of the Commission
- **Relationships:** Adelaide Burkhart, successor

Originally from Ingenium, Glimback was inspired in his youth when the city he called home was torn from one realm and deposited in another in a shower of sparks. He came to Caelum's Landing intent on forming the Relief's greatest explorer's guild. His vision became a reality when in 923 PO his organisation was commissioned by *Ardeat Sol Orbis*, the Exarch, to begin prospecting new earthmotes for colonisation. This eccentric, athletic and adventurous gnome always wears a smile to tint his pocked, rosy cheeks. Portraits of Glimback's many adventures adorn the wall of *Crowswood Place*. His silver widow's peak sticks up as though electrocuted and he is often seen wearing a backpack far too big for him, filled with tools for adventuring and tinkering. Glimback and an expedition of Crows went missing in 995 PO when they ventured into the Miasma.

##### **Adelaide Burkhart**

- **Race:** Human, Female
- **Born:** 958 PO, Arx
- **Roles:** Chief of the Commission
- **Relationships:** Glimback Toestubber, predecessor

A soft-spoken but nonetheless strong and charismatic human, Adelaide Burkhart became the protege of Glimback Toestubber at the age of 19 when she discovered a lost expedition in Os Terrae. Demonstrating her survival knowledge and enthusiasm for adventure, Adelaide guided the expedition to her home city of Arx and earned the admiration of Glimback. Under his tutelage, Adelaide quickly became a capable fighter and wise leader. Adelaide often sports shoulder-length dark brown hair plaited so it doesn't cover her kindly amber eyes. Her unblemished bronze complexion belies her muscular figure.
