title: The League of Archfiends (Faction)
---

The League of Archfiends is said to be a secret cabal of fiends who operate from within the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma), subsidising illegal practices across the [Relief](getting-started#the-relief) that will bring them luxury in their empire beyond the barrier. It is rumoured they even conspired with [Tenebrae](getting-started#tenebrae) to create [Mundi Eversor](getting-started#mundi-eversor) 1,000 years ago, but it has never been proven the organisation exists or ever existed.
