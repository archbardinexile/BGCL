"I love working with the community too. The work may be tough some days, but it doesn't feel like work at all when you're among friends; when you're making a difference." The pair soon enter the Wind District where the road forks into several streets of housing and market stalls. Firien spies a tavern, a general goods store, even an alchemist. The smell of food fills Firien's nostrils as they venture forth and the bustle of the city quickly becomes apparent. Firien blinks rapidly at the sudden shift. They've only just reached the city proper and already the shift in the environment is apparent. They're just thankful it seems difficult to get lost; the spires of the Oratory are easy to see no matter where one stands. With that imposing structure in their sights, Firien continues to walk, hoping not to get swept up in whatever nonsense the big city might have in store.

"Fresh fish! Caught traditionally from the banks of the Fountainhead"
"You look like you could do with a new pair of shoes, sir"
"A sweet treat for your partner, sir?"
Keijo, in contrast, beams with delight at the chaos; the sights and smells. He pauses to buy an exotic fruit from a stall for a few copper. Firien recognises this as a passion fruit, common on Madanau but obviously rare here.
"Mm Wonderful, isn't it? Do you need anything while we're here?"

Firien glances down at the passion fruit Keijo has purchased, and all it really does is remind them of what they've left behind. They train their gaze back to their destination.
"I have everything I need."
. Honestly, I think I'm surprised that only cost you a few copper can't imagine they're common around here.

Keijo nods and beckons Firien to follow.
"Mm I'm pretty sure the government subsidises businesses across the Relief to sell goods in Caelum's Landing I guess that's why it's so popular. and cheap Has your bakery ever come to sell here?"

Firien looks at Keijo in such a manner that doesn't say they think he's asked a stupid question. But perhaps they are thinking it nonetheless.
"Ah, no I don't think that's ever been a prospect We bake fresh and sell throughout the day. Sometimes we do special orders. But no, this is too far away."

"Mmm, well I guess that means you can say your goods are exclusive to Madanau"
Firien might dare to say they know a little more about economics than the young monk. They often helped their mother with the accounts and they had picked up on terms such as tax and markup. Offering bursaries to small businesses to set up shop here was a good idea. It minimised the overhead of cultivation and transportation, allowing businesses to sell more goods at cheaper prices and still make a substantial profit. However, Firien realised this would be funded by an increase in public taxation and, crucially, it diminished the exposure of businesses that operate outside of Caelum's Landing. This seemed like nothing more than a tactic to monopolise on trade across the Relief. Regardless, the bakery had always found its taxes reasonable, likely because of its small scale and location.
"You never know, maybe your bakery could become a franchise in the future"

Firien shakes their head.
"Nah. The bakery's been around almost as long as Madanau itself has. Its longevity is probably because it's a respected local staple. Less taxation, less pressure, able to rely on a steady long-term interest. And the occasional enthusiast who travels out to the town to see what all the fuss is about"

"Hmm that's pretty smart. I can see how this might put pressure on small businesses to deliver You probably wouldn't love working at the bakery so much if that were the case."
Keijo snatches a tomato headed for his face out of the air.
"Oops Hey! Sorry mister"
"We were just messing."
A pair of drow children working one of the stalls wander over. Keijo kneels down to offer the tomato back.
"No harm done But I suggest you stick to selling tomatoes instead of throwing them"
Firien feels a slight tug at their belt.

Firien's senses are keen and their reaction is immediate. Their large hand reaches down to investigate the tug, and they turn their attention downwards, their tail curling in to bracket their body. And whatever is invading their personal space.

A third drow child gasps as Firien grabs his hand. He looks up in terror with big sorrowful eyes and releases Firien's gold pouch.
"Hey! Let go of him"
As Keijo turns to the commotion, one child runs off while the girl tries to defend her friend. She tugs at Firien's armoured arm to no avail.

Firien doesn't budge when the other child ends up practically dangling from their arm. Standing up tall like this, the dragonborn's stature is imposing, foreboding. Then their hand moves to the child's wrist, a gentle hold as they turn and come down to rest at one knee. They make eye contact with the boy, who sees lightning skitter in their eyes. And they open their coinpurse.
"One of these days, you'll encounter someone cruel enough to hurt a child without a second thought. If it's not you, then you might see someone hurt your friends. Is that something you really want to see?"
The young cleric takes three silver pieces out of their purse, then turns the boy's hand over to drop them in his palm.
"Sometimes, it's better to just ask."

The drow shakes his head violently at Firien's interrogative and his eyes grow wide when the dragonborn drops the coins into his hand. The two stare at Firien for a moment. The young lad squeezes the money tight and the two back away.
"Thank you"
They dart off back towards their stall. Their father appears to have since returned to the stall none the wiser.
"That was very kind of you."

Firien looks up, then stands and continues walking as if nothing happened.
"A place this big swallows peoples' problems before they can be solved."
They glance at a tomato that's just sat on the ground in the middle of the street, just waiting for someone to step on or kick.
"Day-old produce and no one looking out for them when their parental figure is busy. A family that's not making ends meet and has no one to help bear the load. Kinda laughable in a city with this many people. But then, most people walking around don't look up."

Keijo's lips become a thin line. He couldn't think of anything to say. Firien was right.
"We're erm. almost at the Oratory, come on"
Firien notices a couple of guards wandering about the market as they walk. They appear to be satisfied no crime was occurring at this time. The Sun District was where most of Caelum's Landing's housing was situated. Thankfully it was much quieter here. Homemakers were hanging out the washing as children played happily in the electrically illuminated streets. To Firien's surprise, no guards questioned their approach to the Oratory. Rather, the grounds were open to the public. They passed several Caelumites praying at the outdoor shrines, while groundskeepers tended to the flower beds in the surrounding park. The Oratory itself was a brilliant grey marble with sharp architecture. Firien had to crane their neck just to see all the way to the top of the spire. The large double doors were open and waiting for them.
"Well here we are"

"Alright then Guess I. Should find out where I'm supposed to go."
They look at the monk beside them and tilt their head at him slightly.
"Thanks for walking with me Uh. Which way is the temple from here?"

Keijo offers a warm smile.
"My pleasure It's erm. northwest of here If you head through the Cloud District you'll find Pilgrim's Road which heads out of the city and through the foothills"

"I'll keep that in mind Have a good day now"
Firien doesn't exactly want to dismiss the monk so quickly. But they feel like they have to be focused for what's to come. They turn back to the imposing entrance and square their shoulders.
"Ahhh. Wish me luck"

"Best of luck, Firien I hope to see you again"
Keijo offers Firien a short wave and turns away once they have resolved to climb the steps to the entrance. As soon as Firien crosses the threshold, their boots begin to echo against the marble floor tiles. The reception hall is a diamond about thirty foot across and twice as high. Effigies of Caelum and the Saints adorn the walls; paintings, sculptures, tapestries and mosaics. A stained glass window to Firien's right depicts Caelum ascending to divinity. It produces sunbeams of wine red, gold and royal blue. There are a number of people sat in quiet prayer, others perhaps waiting for an audience, but no queue or reception desk to speak of. Listening carefully, Firien can hear a choir singing somewhere in the building. After a few moments, the chaplain spots Firien and approaches.
"Good morning, child How can I help you?"

Firien turns to the chaplain, somewhat surprised at being approached, but tries to keep up the brave face as they straighten up and reply.
"Ahh hello I was summoned here from Madanau. Where do new acolytes go?"

"Ah you'll want to speak with Dean Vance. Would you care to follow me?"
The chaplain is a thin human at the end of his middle age. He sports a small grey pointed beard and a waxed moustache.
"And your name is."

"Ah, Firien Madizos"

"Firien Welcome to the Oratory, my name is Willem, I'm one of the Chaplains here."
Willem leads Firien through one of the clergy-only side doors. Crossing this threshold felt like a commitment in itself. Passing through a number of lavishly-carpeted corridors, the two eventually find themselves in one of the halls where a choir of approximately thirty acolytes are in the middle of singing a hymn. The Dean stands at the rostrum while the acolytes stand facing him in the ranks of pews. The Chaplain cups his hands below his waist as he waits for the hymn to finish.
"Thank you. That will be all for today, you are dismissed."
The acolytes begin filing out of the hall and of course they spot Firien in passing. Though respectfully silent, the acolytes' eyes glinted with judgment.

Firien doesn't really notice the look of the acolytes, they just wait patiently for all of them to leave, and once they have, Firien raises a clawed hand to the Dean, then approaches.
"Pardon me, Dean. Ah, I'm Firien, Firien Madizos. Prefect Sana sent me?"

The dean closes the copy of the Ascensus on the rostrum and turns to inspect the dragonborn.
"Prefect Sana. Ah yes, the one blessed by Bahamut. Welcome, Firien, to Caelum's Landing"
The Dean offers his hand. Vance was a human with warm-tinted brown skin and short afro curls. Unlike the Chaplain, he wore an expensive but casual royal blue jumper that accented his build and poise. Instead of the Cleric's armband, he wore a silver pendant in the shape of a ring representing the Sol Orbis halo. The only signs of the man's age were the crows feet at his dark brown eyes.

"Thank you, Dean. I. Basically came straight here as soon as things calmed down in Madanau I'm ready to get settled and learn of what's expected of me here."
Firien tilts their head down slightly in a measure of respect. As much as they can; though the most nervous person present, they are also the tallest, and can't shake the feeling that they're looming a bit too much.

"Is that so? I rather thought you'd have questions before you commit to your new life here."

Firien tilts their head slightly.
"I'm supposed to have questions? I don't know what I might ask. I readily assumed the details of this "new life" would be explained to me when I arrived."

The dean nods in understanding.
"Of course, I can offer you a tour of the facilities and help you get acquainted with your timetable. but you needn't be so acquiescent."
Vance begins to walk with Firien at his side.
"I will encourage you to stay and learn, of course, but should you decide this life does not suit you, you are under no obligation to remain. I welcome any questions you may have after the orientation. In any case, you'll be glad to hear you are not the only acolyte here of another faith."
