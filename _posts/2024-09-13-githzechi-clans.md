title: Githzechi Clans (Faction)
---

The Githzechi Clans are said to be the descendants of githyanki who fell through a portal to the *Astral Plane* several centuries ago. The clans constantly feud over the barren territories of [Os Terrae](calidus#os-terrae) and have developed their psionic abilities to survive its harsh sands. While some uphold their faith in *Vlaakith*, others seek their fortune in Os Terrae's grand sinkhole that provides precious materials from the *Elemental Plane of Earth*.
