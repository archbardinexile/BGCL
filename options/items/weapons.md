## **Compound Bow**

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon.* 60 gp, 4 lb.

**1d8 piercing. Ammunition (150/600 ft.), heavy, two‑handed.**

This weapon's levering system allows you to keep the bowstring drawn for extended durations without tiring. You do not have disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls when attacking at long range with this weapon.

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Two-handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

## **Crow's Lantern Flail**

*Martial weapon, melee weapon, very rare (requires attunement).* 2 lb.

**1d8 bludgeoning. Reach, special.**

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light and disperse fog in a 30-foot radius and shed dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.

The weapon has 4 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the flail, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra ***1d8 radiant*** damage to the target. The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.

**Special.** You can attempt to grapple a creature as part of your attack with this weapon (you do not need a free hand).

## **Grappling Whip**

*Martial weapon, melee weapon.* 6 gp, 3 lb.

**1d4 slashing. Finesse, reach, special.**

You can use this weapon to climb up to 10 feet or swing up to 15 feet by grappling an adequate support above you.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Special.** You can attempt to grapple a creature as part of your attack with this weapon (you do not need a free hand).

## **Halo of Caelum**

*Martial weapon, melee weapon, artefact (requires attunement).* 6 lb.

**3d6 slashing + 3d8 radiant. Thrown (30/120 ft.), heavy, two‑handed.**

As an action, you can make up to 3 ranged attacks with this magic chakram. Target up to 3 creatures within range. You can target the same creature more than once. The chakram bounces between each of the targets, dealing ***1d6 slashing damage + 1d8 radiant damage*** on a hit. The chakram returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

## **Poison Blade of the Ambitious Assassin**

*Simple weapon, melee weapon, rare (requires attunement).* 1 lb.

**1d4 piercing + 1d10 poison. Finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.).**

This magic weapon returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

## **Staff of Gravity**

*Simple weapon, melee weapon, spellcasting focus (requires attunement).*

**1d6 force. Versatile (1d8). Artificer Infusion.**

A knot in the wood of this staff provides adequate space for you to scribe a mystical cipher as if ***scribing a spell scroll***. To do so, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and be attuned to the staff. The spell must be among your known ***Graviturgy*** spells and you must provide any material components required for the casting of that spell. Scribing a cipher takes an amount of time related to the level of the spell you want to scribe, but never less than 8 hours.

You can read the cipher and cast its spell without providing any material components. Casting the spell in this way requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the cipher fades, allowing another to be scribed. If the casting is interrupted, the cipher is not lost.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Artificer Infusion: Enhanced Arcane Focus.** While holding this item, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.
