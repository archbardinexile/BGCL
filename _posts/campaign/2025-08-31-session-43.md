Begrudgingly, **Firien** dictates the rules of the game to the *morkoth*. The ghost crew of the *Draa'zvir* must number the same as the *Verity* and if hit, they must disappear. **Guy** tarries for a moment, seemingly to conspire with the morkoth. As a gesture of good will, he relinquishes the weather gauge advantage before offering advice laced with truths and lies. The morkoth rubs its tentacles together in excitement, unaware of Guy's plan. *Spiro* rubs his temples when Firien explains the situation. Captain Brush orders the crew to begin fortifying the Verity ready for battle.

***The Verity's maximum HP increases to 292.***

### The Verity

Following Guy's advice, the morkoth sails straight into the Verity's gunsights on a favourable wind. Traversing the gap between two earthmotes, the Verity mounts an ambush! Her opening dual-cannon salvo penetrates the spelljammer's hull, revealing the morkoth's putrid flesh beneath. Spotting a weak point, **Gomruss** launches a fireball, splintering the deck. Githyanki mages rush to douse the fires. Furious, the morkoth cracks its spelljammer shell in two, whipping its stern around to take aim at the Verity. Taken off guard by the morkoth's duplicitous speed, Guy gives Firien the signal.

Firien's sharp topaz eyes find the metal breech of the spelljammer's giant cannon. Uttering a draconic prayer, they summon a tumultuous sleet storm. Unaffected by the slippery deck, the ghost crew try to load the cannon, only to find the breech frozen shut! In a fit of rage, the morkoth orders a longbow volley before the Verity can disappear behind cover. The volley punctures the Verity's mizzen sail and Spiro staggers back as an arrow pierces his shoulder. The Grand Paladin plucks the arrow from his wound and tosses it aside, drawing the gaze of Firien.
