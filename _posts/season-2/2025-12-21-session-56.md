title: Session 56 Wake of Disaster
---

While the *Six of Steel* debate their next move, **Arti** and **Gomruss** follow *Daniel* to his workshop. After rummaging through several mounds of clutter, Daniel pulls out his old pair of ***high jump boots*** which he offers to Arti as a gift. **Guy** asks for a copy of the map. Instead, Daniel suggests they borrow *DAV3* so they might have a live projection of Anchorheart's movements through *Killigrew Mor*. DAV3 seems bewildered when **Bantonio** places a hat atop its ovoid head.

### The Marley

*Elyse* paces as she summarises the Six of Steel's options. They could follow the *Umberlee's Wrath* now they knew its heading, but she dare not risk the *Marley* in an engagement with *Anchorheart*'s flotilla—not without support. They could visit *Anchora* and appeal to Vice Admiral *Kilik*, but this would mean spending three days sailing in the opposite direction. Guy remains hesitant to contact his father, though he might be able to marshal CSCA support given time and incentive. Finally, Elyse suggests Guy lure Anchorheart to a remote island with the promise of handing over the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle. They could set the terms of engagement. However, there was little chance Anchorheart would abide by those terms.

**Firien** strokes their chin. Perhaps the Church could provide support. They cast sending to Chaplain *Durzus* and report their progress, subtly revealing their knowledge of the basilisk venom. Though taken aback, Durzus reveals that only he and the chaplains were informed of Prefect *Jeremias Blackflight*'s precautionary purchase. Evidently, the prefect expected a Mallian incursion but did not want to spread alarm. With this new information, Firien suggests Elyse drop the Six of Steel off at *Sullivanwick*, intent on securing the prefect’s support. The Marley could then set sail for Anchora without them.

The Marley sets sail north-west and Firien returns to their quarters to cast another sending. *Spiro* scoffs at the mention of Blackflight and warns of his parsimony. According to the Grand Paladin, Blackflight is a distant relation of the Sol Orbis family. Firien might persuade him by wounding his pride. **Blythe** signals the approach of a curious merchant ship. The paddle steamer appears to be driven by a tortle sat at a pipe organ. Coloured smoke belches from the smokestacks as he plays. The ship's name is painted on its bow—the *Pompous Piper*.
