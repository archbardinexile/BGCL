##### **Fundus Park to Caelum's Landing**

Fundus Park has several amenities one might need after a lengthy journey. A tavern, several inns, even a tourist information centre. The park itself has rolling green hills and a lush pond with a statuesque fountain in the centre. There is an elderly dwarf selling ice cream. Past the park are patchwork fields of yellow rapeseed, maize, wheat and other cereals dotted with the windmill homes of farmers. The ruckus of the town is replaced with the chirps of grasshoppers when the party makes their way down the road.

- Players can choose to walk to Caelum's Landing or get a taxi: taxi holds 4, 6 silver per taxi.

Players enter the *Wind District* where shoppers and tourists can find the heart of the Relief's commerce. Players can find the stalls of travelling merchants, workshops of craftsmen from all over the Relief, and skilled alchemists who can both heal and invigorate the most daring of adventurers. Today is the Guilds Exhibition where guilds from all over the Relief can sell goods and recruit members.

**Attending guilds:**

- Church of Caelum, recruiting acolytes, accepting charity
- The Commission, recruiting explorers
- The Diamond Guard, recruiting squires
- The Ministry, offering careers advice
- Inland guard, recruiting constables
- Miner's Union, raising awareness of terrible conditions in Resonant Mines
- Bounty Hunters' Codex, local lodge offering jobs: retrieve, deliver, exterminate, eliminate
- Merchants' Guild, selling goods
- Caelum's Landing University, handing our prospectuses, offering glider lessons
