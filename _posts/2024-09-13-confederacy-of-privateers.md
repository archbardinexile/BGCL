The Confederacy of Privateers is a loose alliance of pirates, privateers and merchant crews governed by those with the largest fleets and the greatest wealth. The bowels of [Raptor Island](contritus#raptor-island) serve as headquarters for the ever-changing members of a pirate moot that keep the various guilds of the [Manyshells](contritus#the-manyshells) in check, while the mayor of [Anchora](contritus#anchora) acts only as their figurehead.
