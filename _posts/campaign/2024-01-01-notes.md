## **Session 22 (996, Roscidas 20th)**

Eureka recognises the family crest of Santiago on Bantonio's handkerchief and confronts him in private.

### Warforged Malfunction

Warforged miners at the Resonite Processing Plant malfunction and sabotage the factory equipment. They have been reprogrammed by a union member in order to prevent warforged stealing miners' jobs in the Resonant Mines. The party have **1 hour** until the lockdown is lifted and the suspects are allowed to leave. There are 8 suspects who worked the last 4-hour shift:

- **Jehane.** Female fire genasi senior smith. Leads production on floors 1-5 which creates resonance engines for mining equipment. Innocent.
  - **Alfred Bug.** Human male smith. Has a friend who works for the Ministry who told him about plans to use warforged to mine the Resonant Mines. Innocent.
  - **Ugun.** Half-orc male smith. Shy, has a family of 6 to feed so wouldn't jeopardise his job. Innocent.
  - **Denys.** Tiefling male smith. Ate Droop's goblin pocket, kinda dumb. Innocent.
- **Droop.** Goblin male foreman. In charge of automaton and warforged scheduling and maintenance. Visits all 20 floors. Innocent.
  - **Norhice Nolti.** Halfling female maintenance. Was helping Droop conduct maintenance when the warforged attacked and had a panic attack. Innocent.
  - **Fulbert Guzzark.** Dwarf male data scribe. Can be seen entering the commands into each terminal through warforged eyes. Claims he should have checked the data before entering but was distracted by Jehane. Innocent.
  - **Ivrinn Goldmask.** Dwarf male data writer. Wrote the malicious command. Alfred told him about the plans to replace miners with warforged and set a plan in motion to protect his brother's job. **Guilty.**
- **Parnella Youngbloom.** Gnome female receptionist. Old and cranky, constantly filing her nails after typing at 100 wpm. Dislikes automatons for stealing jobs. Innocent.

### Anchorheart's Firearm

The triple-barrelled gemlock rifle is stored in a warehouse opposite the IIA. The rifle can be pre-ordered from *Brogar Stonehelm* for 3000 gold.

- The warehouse may be entered secretly through the chimney. It is guarded by:
  - 2 automatons and 2 guards
  - Magical tripwire alarms.
  - Magical lock which can be dispelled on a successful DC 14 spellcasting ability check.

### Anchorheart's Folly

*Lenna Madizos* returns from clearing out Tenebrae's Refuge mine. She was recently recalled from her work providing aid to the Manyshells and has been investigating why. Her only lead is the Church requisitioning vast amounts of Basilisk oil through independent guilds so it goes unnoticed. The basilisk oil is in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia, who have warriors that can petrify with their gaze.

**Guy**'s captain, *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* ordered Guy to retrieve a resonite weapon from Caelum's Landing. He did not expect the half-elf to return. Anchorheart may let Guy in on his secret. He has made a deal with Vasilissa to force the CSCA out of the Manyshells.

### Investigate the Submarine

The party investigate the factory where the submarine is being constructed. *Loronath Highbrow Muthalavea*, a well-dressed goliath, offers a tour of the facility. The submarine is a second generation deep-sea exploration vehicle designed to explore the *Vena Trench*. Loronath knows nothing about the Crosscut Circle.

Guy may meet *Agnes Briar Colton*, his former nanny, as part of the tour. She has been investigating the CSCA's partial funding of the submarine. A raise in import and export tariffs seems to be in aid of expanding their fleet in the Manyshells.

- The submarine can be seen under construction from above when the factory roof is open during the day.

### Find Naal Berevan

Naal was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Constable *Denover*'s proposal to send in his own undercover agent was refused so he couldn't interfere.

- The Crosscut Circle may kidnap **Blythe** if her snooping proves a hindrance.
  - Camren may try to recruit Blythe and test her resolve by ordering her to deface the statue of Caelum.
  - The Crosscut Circle intend to steal a submarine being transported from Ingenium to Fundus. They wish to use this to recover the body of Tenebrae (Arzhang).

### Capture a Basilisk

A mission issued to the Commission by the Church of Caelum. Capture a Basilisk using an Imprison Creature scroll. The Church may be harvesting basilisk venom in preparation as tensions rise again with Mallia.

- Travel to 2d12 location by glider or airship.
- **Basilisk CR 2.** ***Bite.*** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d6+2 piercing + 2d6 poison.
- **Young Basilisk CR 1.** ***Bite.*** +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d4+1 piercing + 1d4 poison.
- Players must be careful of *petrifying gaze*

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry cannot confirm the existence of the fallen miner as there is no paper trail. Therefore the implementation of better health and safety in the mines is on hold. The miner who fell was in fact an illusion created by an agent of the *Mining Consortium* in order to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from *Micantrum* instead of the *Garnetgrinder Clan*.

- Snicker Nickelfoot is in the mining village on the Resonant Mines.
- Gerti Garnetgrinder despises that she comes from a banking family, but does not speak ill of her parents.

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* is offering work clearing out a buried tomb in Os Terrae. The airship to Arx won't depart until Darshan has finished his work at Crowswood Place.

### Confront River Chapman

Gomruss may find a shrine to Tymora through which he can converse with *Chance*, Tymora's emissary. She has been trapped in a mirror by River Chapman, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

River Chapman may trap the party in his game room. They will face dice monsters in a strange chequerboard plane.
