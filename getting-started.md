For almost a millennium the world of *Fio* has been plagued by an unnatural, perpetual storm of its own creation; the *Miasma*, a harrowing purple fog that only the bravest of adventurers dare to enter. But in the northern hemisphere, safe harbour endures. The city of *Caelum's Landing* sits at the heart of a circular *Relief* in the storm. It was here that *Caelum Sol Orbis* sacrificed himself to shield his homeland from the oncoming storm 1,000 years ago. In doing so, the land began to fracture and rise, creating the *earthmotes*, large chunks of land that float above the ground. This event has come to be known as the *Rising*. You begin your adventure in the year 999 PO, almost 1,000 years after the founding of Caelum's Landing.

### A World Obscured

The world of Fio is estimated by scholars to be approximately 7,500 miles in diameter. It takes 288 days for Fio to orbit its sun, *Sol* and 24 hours to complete one rotation around its polar axis. Fio oscillates on its equatorial axes causing a change in axial tilt from 23° to -23° and a change in average temperature from 6℃ to 21℃ over the course of six days. The days are named *Menoday*, *Skewday*, *Winday*, *Mariday*, *Sterday* and *Sunday*. Sunday is the longest day while Winday is the shortest. Fio has a single moon, *Auga*, which sits above the northern hemisphere in geostationary orbit. Auga appears to circle the sky above the Relief once every week and transitions from new to full every day.

##### **The Miasma**

With the exception of the Relief, Fio is believed to be completely engulfed by the Miasma, a purple fog that envelops the globe and reaches almost 36,000 feet into the sky. The denizens of *Nox*, the highest earthmote in the Relief, are able to see the vast blanket of magical fog from above, enshrouding the world. The Miasma has tides affected by Fio's moon. Malformed landscape plagued by sickened flora and fauna is revealed at the fringes of the Relief then concealed again on a six-day cycle. Occasionally, migrating monsters and even rogue earthmotes emerge from the Miasma, proving that survival is possible beyond the barrier. Adventurers that brave the Miasma occasionally return with tales of strange stone pillars that can be activated to disperse areas of the gloom. Though the history of these pillars remains a mystery.

##### **Caelum's Light**

Caelum's Light is a holiday celebrated across the Relief. It marks the beginning of a new year as Fio passes through a wondrous aurora. Chromatic ribbons illuminate the sky at midnight every 24th of Ascendentem. The light is believed to be a blessing from Caelum, the colours representing the pride or shame he may feel for his people at the year's end. Since the arrival of Nox in in 192 PO, it is believed that a new earthmote appears somewhere on Fio during every Caelum's Light. Scholars believe that this is a result of Fio passing through a planar portal created by Caelum when he ascended to divinity 1,000 years ago. The arriving earthmotes can vary greatly in size and biome and can be deposited anywhere in Fio. Most earthmotes are uninhabited chunks of land which may house valuable minerals. On the occasion a populated earthmote arrives in the Relief, the *Church of Caelum* are the first to extend a hand of welcome and help reorient the newcomers.

### Welcome to the Relief

The Relief is a circular expanse in the northern hemisphere of Fio unaffected by the Miasma. Approximately 1,000 miles in diameter, the Relief spans six unique regions with an abundance of culture that transcends even the barriers between the planes of existence.

- [**Profundus**](_posts/2024-09-15-profundus.md) is the largest region at the centre of the Relief. It plays host to Caelum's Landing, the capital city of *Fundus* and the most prominent and populous city in the known world.

- [**Glacialis**](_posts/2024-09-15-glacialis.md), the frozen region to the north, suffers arctic climates that only the stalwart denizens of Nox can endure.

- [**Contritus**](_posts/2024-09-15-contritus.md), the easternmost region, is broken by the far-reaching fjords and archipelagos of the *Manyshells*. To the south-east, the enormous jungle earthmote *Mallia* appears to drain the sea with curtains of vines that veil its shores.

- [**Calidus**](_posts/2024-09-15-calidus.md), the southernmost region, is blanketed by harsh sands, yet many varied cultures thrive here. For most, the heat is preferable to the darkened landscape beyond the Miasma, where powerful fiends are said to watch with envious eyes.

- [**Montanum**](_posts/2024-09-15-montanum.md) to the west is characterised by its expansive mountain ranges. Much of Montanum is engulfed by the Miasma, while the peninsula of *Porta Ignota* serves as an invaluable trade hub for intrepid explorers.

- [**Discidium**](_posts/2024-09-15-discidium.md), though completely engulfed by the Miasma, can still be seen beyond the barrier to the south-west as the red glow of lava and lightning storms illuminate the purple fog. At the centre of Discidium lies the crater from which *Mundi Eversor* emerged 1,000 years ago.

##### **Caelum's Landing**

With an area of 150 square miles, *Fundus* appears to those sailing the *Altum Ocean* below as a mighty inverted mountain in the clouds. Its underbelly glimmers with enchanted *resonite* ores that keep it afloat. Sitting atop Fundus, Caelum's Landing is the capital city of the most prominent nation in the Relief, the *Church of Caelum*, which rose to power when Caelum Sol Orbis ascended to shield Fundus from the growing Miasma almost 1,000 years ago. Once known as *Anfang*, the city serves as the beating economic and cultural heart of the vast archipelagos and floating islands that constitute the Relief. Caelum's Landing is home to nearly 100,000 people of countless races and cultures.

### The Ascension of Caelum

The *Ascensus in Caelum* chronicles Caelum's struggle against Mundi Eversor and his ascent to divinity. Caelum Sol Orbis was born an aasimar from human parentage on the 24th day of Ascendentem 64 AO in the city of Anfang, now known as Caelum's Landing. Raised by a religious family, Caelum quickly gained renown as a paladin of *Lathander*. His generosity and exploits protecting Anfang justified his rise to power in the *Church of Lathander*. Caelum is described as being quiet and kindly but fiercely determined and dutiful. He had warm-tinted brown skin, sky-blue eyes, and is depicted sporting hair ranging from a buzz cut to short afro curls. Caelum had a distinctive silver halo on his forehead as a result of his aasimar heritage. The halo would be passed down to his daughter, *Prima Vita*, born on the 4th day of Niveus 22 AO, and all her descendants. The halo would become the symbol for the Church of Caelum. The first of the Church of Lathander to be given the title *Grand Paladin*, Caelum was tasked with protecting Anfang from the colossus Mundi Eversor on 0 AO, which would eventually lead to his ascension and the Rising.

##### **Mundi Eversor**

Mundi Eversor was the name of the colossus created by the fiend *Tenebrae* to destroy the world. The Ascensus teaches us that one millennium ago, Caelum Sol Orbis did battle with Eversor and in its destruction the Miasma was released from its dark, crystalline heart. The resulting magical shock wave enchanted the deposits of resonite in the earth and the earthmotes began to rise. As a fissure opened up around his home, Caelum stood at the centre of Anfang and raised a mighty golden shield to hold back the Miasma as Fundus rose into the sky. Once the danger had subsided, Caelum's body erupted into a coruscation of light, and he ascended to godhood. The city was renamed Caelum's Landing in recognition of the saviour. This event is known as the Rising. The Church of Lathander would eventually transition into the nascent Church of Caelum. To the erde-south-west, the derelict remains of the ancient colossus can still be seen protruding from the Altum Ocean.

##### **Tenebrae**

Little is known of the fiend Tenebrae. Further chronicles held deep within the Oratory's vaults make reference to them only as the shadowy being behind the construction of Mundi Eversor. The *Insequentes Umbra*, a unique painting also held in the vaults, depicts them as a cambion who wields a hellish flaming great-sword as they stand upon the shoulder of Mundi Eversor. The figure is depicted in silhouette with large barbed horns and dragon-like wings.

### An Era of Innovation

A millennium of living in such isolated conditions has inspired a wealth of technological innovations across the Relief. It is commonplace to find valiant adventurers flying off to uncharted territories on canvas gliders, and expeditions of hot air balloons searching for new lands to settle. Airships from foreign lands will deliver dignitaries hoping to take advantage of Caelum's Landing's thriving marketplace, and tourists can travel the *Innermotes* in style on powered cable cars. The most wealthy of denizens can even be found driving rudimentary auto-mobiles, powered by resonance engines.

##### **Resonance Engines**

Perhaps chief among the nascent technologies developed since the Rising is the resonance engine, invented by *Artifex Calligo* in 756 PO to propel *Ingenium* toward Fundus. Resonance engines use the magical properties of resonite, a lustrous, dark purple ore found in the *Resonant Mines*, to create kinetic energy. The ore is capable of exerting magical pressures on its surroundings, making it difficult to cast magic in close proximity to rich deposits. The ore can be refined into resonance stones. Much like how the similar poles of two magnets repel, the magical pressures of two resonance stones forced together can create motion. Resonance engines are used in machines such as auto-mobiles, aircraft, power generators and even rail-guns. Some have even theorised that the heart used to power Mundi Eversor was a prototype resonance engine on a colossal scale.

### Finding Adventure

The world of Fio holds many opportunities for budding adventurers. Join one of its many factions or make your own adventure and explore Fio's uncharted regions. Along the way, you may uncover secrets that lead to the truth behind Caelum's ascent to divinity. Ancient pillars discovered in the Miasma seem to hold magically recorded memories. The vaults beneath the Oratory are said to contain forbidden knowledge. Rogue factions you may encounter claim to work to expose the hypocrisy of the Church. You must decide which path to take.

- [**The Church of Caelum**](_posts/2024-09-13-church-of-caelum.md) is the most prominent nation in the Relief. Ruled by the *Exarch*, *Aura Sol Orbis*, its territories stretch as far as the Miasma. Its capital, Caelum's Landing, is the largest and most populous city in the Relief, with much of the continent's trade passing through its markets. Since the creation of the *Fundus Constitution* in 416 PO, governance of the nation has been shared with the *Ministry*, while the *Inland Guard* police the capital.

- [**The Commission**](_posts/2024-09-13-commission.md) for the Research of Offshore Worlds, affectionately called Crows, was founded by *Glimback Toestubber* in 899 PO. Originally known as the *Explorer's Guild*, Crows has since secured government funding and its members now work to catalogue the many beasts of the Relief, research new magic, and prospect new earthmotes for colonisation. They operate out of *Crowswood Place* on Fundus.

- [**The Order of the Lantern**](_posts/2024-09-13-commission.md) is a clandestine organisation of *Blood Hunters* who undergo a ritual that allows them to safely navigate and research the Miasma. They have strong ties with the Commission.

- [**The Spirit Temple**](_posts/2024-09-13-spirit-temple.md) monks seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue earthmotes and send them back into the Miasma. They have an agreement with the Church that enables them to serve alongside expeditions and help prevent natural disasters.

- [**The Dawnroot Druids**](_posts/2024-09-13-dawnroot-druids.md) make their home in the Dawnroot Forest on Fundus, secluded from the trappings of lifestyle in the capital. They revere and protect a portal to the elemental plane of water, the source of the *Fountainhead River*, which they believe to be a blessing from *Silvanus*, the deity of wild nature. Though they disapprove of the Church's expansionist practices, they seem to prefer not to intervene.

- [**The Cult of Tenebrae**](_posts/2024-09-13-cult-of-tenebrae.md) work in the shadows to expose the hypocrisy of the Church of Caelum. They claim the Miasma was released 1,000 years ago as a result of Caelum's ritual to expel the darkness within him so that he might to ascend to divinity. They also claim Mundi Eversor was created by Tenebrae and his followers in order to stop Caelum.

- [**The League of Archfiends**](_posts/2024-09-13-league-of-archfiends.md) is said to be a secret cabal of fiends who operate from within the Miasma, subsidising illegal practices across the Relief that will bring them luxury in their empire beyond the barrier. It is rumoured they even conspired with Tenebrae to create Mundi Eversor 1,000 years ago, but it has never been proven the organisation exists or ever existed.

- [**The Confederacy of Privateers**](_posts/2024-09-13-confederacy-of-privateers.md) is a loose alliance of pirates, privateers and merchant crews governed by those with the largest fleets and the greatest wealth. The bowels of *Raptor Island* serve as headquarters for the ever-changing members of a pirate moot that keep the various guilds of the Manyshells in check, while the mayor of *Anchora* acts only as their figurehead.

Other factions that can be found across the Relief include: the *Mining Consortium*, an organisation that regulates the trade of resonite and other minerals to and from *Micantrum*; the *Bounty Hunters Codex*, a code of honour that binds all hunters, hunter parties and lodges to prevent infighting and ensure business remains profitable; and the *Merchants Guild*, a union of tradespeople operating out of *Arx* that sponsor and protect independent merchants across the Relief. Other characters you encounter may travel the Relief independently or work on behalf of a guild or society. Routinely, these characters can offer freelance work for budding adventurers. You might find yourself protecting a cable car of perishable goods from *Zipper Pirates* or catching rare and exotic fish for the *Fishing Guild*.
