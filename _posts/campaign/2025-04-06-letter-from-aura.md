A letter to Art from Exarch Aura Sol Orbis.

> The Oratory, Caelum's Landing. 996, Roscidas 20th.
>
> Dearest Arti,
>
> I first wish to thank you, Adelaide and the Commission for your proposal to find and rescue the expedition team lost in the Miasma. I have found your research to be promising and your proposed safety measures extremely thorough. Though I remain apprehensive of the unforeseen dangers that venturing into the Miasma will undoubtedly present, I believe your work is a strong step toward better understanding the blight that has plagued our world for almost a millennium.
>
> Though I fully support your commitment to rescuing Glimback, with whom I appreciate you have formed a strong bond, the nature of the magic you propose to use in countering the effects of the Miasma warrants further scrutiny. Under normal circumstances, I would be willing to grant the Commission an exemption from blood magic restrictions for the purposes of this expedition. However, as I'm sure you understand, the act of infusing one's blood with Miasma yields significant religious and ethical implications.
>
> It is with regret I must inform you that your proposal has come to the attention of the Inquisition, who demand you attend a formal hearing at the Oratory on Roscidas 26th. You shall present your proposal to Grand Inquisitor Tristis Veritas alongside Adelaide Burkhart, Hadley Pinchbrew, Doom and Lathraia. In attendance will be myself; Grand Paladin Spiro Sol Orbis; Sana Sol Orbis, Prefect of Madanau; and Clara Sol Orbis, former Prefect of Tenebrae's Refuge.
>
> I realise your proposed expedition is time-sensitive. Therefore, I recommend you continue with your preparations in the meantime. The Grand Inquisitor will call into question the dangers of Lathraia's blood ritual and its opposition to Church ideals. You must also convince him the expedition is worth risking your lives. I look forward to seeing you again and wish you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
>
> Your servant,
> Aura Sol Orbis
