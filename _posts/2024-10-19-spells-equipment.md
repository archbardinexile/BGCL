- **Components:** V, S, M (a shamrock leaf, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

### Double or Nothing

*1st-level divination*

- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take after making an attack roll
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Whenever you make an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll an additional d20. You can cast this spell after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll. If the attack hits, it becomes a critical hit. If the attack misses, you have disadvantage on your next attack roll. You cannot cast this spell in reaction to an attack roll that already has advantage or disadvantage.

### Joy's Mailed Mockery

*Enchantment cantrip*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Components:** S, M (a sheet of parchment, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You scribble a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments onto a sheet of parchment. The parchment folds itself into a paper plane and flies toward the target. If the target opens the parchment, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

There is a chance the parchment will be damaged when travelling distances over 120 feet. The DM may ask for an ability check to determine whether the spell reaches its target.

### Lantern Flail

*Martial weapon, melee weapon, artefact (requires attunement).* 2 lb.

**1d8 bludgeoning.**

You gain a ***+1 bonus*** to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a hit, the target takes an extra ***1d4 radiant damage***. This weapon sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It also disperses fog out to a radius of 30 feet. The fog reforms behind you as you move through it.

### Stonelock Pistol

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon, firearm, rare.* 500 gp, 3 lb.

**2d6 piercing. Ammunition (50/150 ft.), loading.**

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Stonelock Musket

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon, firearm, rare.* 1000 gp, 10 lb.

**2d8 piercing. Ammunition (80/240 ft.), loading, two-handed.**

**Two-handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

### Zip-Wheel

*Improvised weapon, ranged weapon, firearm.* 200 gp, 3 lb.

**3d4 bludgeoning. Ammunition (15 ft. cone), loading, two-handed.**

You drop a handful of ball bearings into your zip-wheel while it spins at high speed. On an attack roll of 5 or less: the zip-wheel jams and must be repaired using an action.
