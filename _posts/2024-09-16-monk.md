- (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- 10 darts

### Optional Class Features

This section offers additional features that you can gain as a monk. Unlike the features in the ***Player's Handbook***, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

### Level 1

##### **Unarmored Defense**

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armour and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

##### **Martial Arts**

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armour or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.

- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.

- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialised forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).

### Level 2

##### **Ki**

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: **Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

- **Flurry of Blows.** Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

- **Patient Defense.** You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

- **Step of the Wind.** You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

##### **Unarmored Movement**

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armour or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

##### **Dedicated Weapon (Optional)**

Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

- The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
- You must be proficient with it.
- It must lack the heavy and special properties.

### Level 3

##### **Monastic Tradition**

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. The following options are available to you when making that choice:

- **Way of the Spirit Temple.** Monks of the Way of the Spirit Temple seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue earthmotes and send them back into the Miasma.

##### **Deflect Missiles**

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

##### **Ki-Fueled Attack (Optional)**

Also at 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.

##### **Absorb Ki (Optional)**

Also at 3rd level, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from its attack roll. If the creature misses, you gain ki points equal to the number you rolled.

### Level 4

##### **Ability Score Improvement**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### **Slow Fall**

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

##### **Quickened Healing (Optional)**

Also at 4th level, as an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.

### Level 5

##### **Extra Attack**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##### **Stunning Strike**

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

##### **Focused Aim (Optional)**

Also at 5th level, when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.

### Level 6

##### **Ki-Empowered Strikes**

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

### Level 7

##### **Evasion**

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##### **Stillness of Mind**

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Level 10

##### **Purity of Body**

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### Level 13

##### **Tongue of the Sun and Moon**

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

### Level 14

##### **Diamond Soul**

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to re-roll it and take the second result.

### Level 15

##### **Timeless Body**

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Level 18

##### **Empty Body**

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the ***astral projection*** spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.

### Level 20

##### **Perfect Self**

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

# Monastic Traditions

### Way of the Spirit Temple

##### **Spirit Guardian**

At 3rd level, you adopt a spirit guardian and gain its feature. You must train with masters of the Spirit Temple or study the behaviour of an appropriate animal in the wild. The animal you study may be similar to those listed here or be more appropriate for your homeland. For example, you may choose to study a leopard or lion in place of a tiger. You can adopt an additional spirit guardian of your choice at 6th, 11th and 17th level. Whenever you adopt a new spirit guardian, you can choose to dismiss one spirit guardian and replace it with a different spirit guardian available to you at that level.

Some spirit guardians allow you to cast spells. Casting a spell requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as ***burning hands*** does. The spell's level increases by one for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the table below.

| Monk Level | Spirit Guardians | Max Ki for a spell |

| 3          | 1                | 2                  |

| 12         | 3                | 4                  |
| 13         | 3                | 5                  |

| 16         | 3                | 5                  |
| 17         | 4                | 6                  |
| 18         | 4                | 6                  |
| 19         | 4                | 6                  |
| 20         | 4                | 6                  |

##### **Spirit Guardians**

**Bear.** While your ki points are at their maximum, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

**Crane (6th Level Required).** ***Deflect missiles*** now affects ranged spell attacks. If you have the ***mantis*** spirit guardian, you can also deflect ranged spell attacks targeting allies within 5 feet of you.

**Deer.** When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed, leaving behind an illusory duplicate of yourself. The duplicate's AC is equal to your own and it has 1 hit point. The creature must attack the duplicate unless it makes a successful Wisdom saving throw. The duplicate is destroyed at the start of your next turn.

**Eagle (11th Level Required).** You can spend 4 ki points to cast ***fly***.

**Elephant.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. In addition, choose one 1st-level spell to learn from the druid spell list, it costs 2 ki points to cast at its lowest level. If it is listed as a ritual, you can cast it as a ritual.

**Lizard (6th Level Required).** You can spend 3 ki points to cast ***invisibility***.

**Mantis.** ***Deflect missiles*** now affects ranged weapon attacks targeting allies within 5 feet of you.

**Monkey (11th Level Required).** You can spend 4 ki points to create 2 spectral floating hands at a point you choose within 30 feet. The hands last for 1 minute or until you dismiss them as an action. The hands must stay together and they vanish if they are ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. The hands' ability scores, hit point maximum and AC equal your own. You can move the hands up to 30 feet each time you use them.

You can use your action to control the hands. You can use the hands to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can use your bonus action to make 2 unarmed strikes with the hands, using your martial arts die in place of the normal damage and adding any modifiers you would if you had used ***flurry of blows***.

**Snake (17th Level Required).** You can spend 5 ki points to cast ***freedom of movement***.

**Tiger.** When you use ***flurry of blows***, add your wisdom modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. You can choose whether flurry of blows deals bludgeoning damage or slashing damage.

**Turtle.** You can spend 2 ki points to cast ***shield***.

**Wolf (17th Level Required).** Whenever an ally within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, they can roll 1d4 times the number of allies within 30 feet of you and add the total to the attack roll or saving throw.
