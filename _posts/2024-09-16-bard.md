### College of Retainers

The College of Retainers

##### **Bonus Proficiencies**

When you join the College of Retainers at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with a weapon of your choice and: (a) 2 skills, (b) 2 tools, (c) 1 skill and 1 tool.

##### **Teaching Method**

Starting at 3rd level, you can choose a willing creature to become your ***ward***. You can only have one ward at a time and you must finish a long rest before you can choose a new ward. Once per short rest, you can discuss a ***teaching method*** of your choice with your ward. While your ward is within 60 feet of you, it gains benefits according to the method you chose.

- **Flexibility.** Your ward can add half its proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes that doesn't already include its proficiency bonus, provided you are proficient with that skill, weapon or saving throw.
- **Discipline.** When your ward fails an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw after using a Bardic Inspiration die, it can re-roll the die and must use the new roll.
- **Engagement.**
- **Memorisation.**

##### **Legal Guardian**
