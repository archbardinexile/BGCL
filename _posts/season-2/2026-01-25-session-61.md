title: Session 61 The Siege of Farwest—Part 1
---

Through his spyglass, **Guy** spies a flash of electric blue aboard the captive githzechi ship. *Anchorheart* was undoubtedly interrogating the crew. *Faust* declares they must assume Anchorheart now knows everything the githzechi know. **Firien** contacts *Vetra* to announce their arrival and report the githzechi ship's capture. As they suspected, Vetra chose not to tell the githzechi the submarine's new location. Furthermore, traps had been laid along the straits to *Serpent's Creek*. With the fog dispersed, **Blythe** can clearly identify eight ships, including the *Umberlee's Wrath*, under Anchorheart's command. They lay in wait as the *Lady Firehair* crossed the threshold into *Farwest*.
