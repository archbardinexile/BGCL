The *Ascensus in Caelum* teaches us that one millennium ago, [Caelum Sol Orbis](getting-started#caelum-sol-orbis) did battle with [Mundi Eversor](getting-started#mundi-eversor), a great colossus created by the fiend [Tenebrae](getting-started#tenebrae) to destroy the world. The years before Caelum's battle with Mundi Eversor are suffixed with *AO*, meaning *Ante Orientem* or *Before the Rising*, while the years after are suffixed with *PO*, meaning *Post Orientem* or *After the Rising*.

## **Ante Orientem**

### c. 1000 AO

#### **Anfarwol arrives on Fio**

*Anfarwol*, an Eladrin, enters Fio through a portal to the Feywild. His influence on the land would make it bountiful, causing flora and fauna from the Feywild to emerge. This land would eventually become the *Sylvan Kingdoms*.

#### **Caer Wraidd is built**

Anfarwol treks to [Anfang](locations#caelums-landing) and imposes his order on the disparate human societies. Enslaved by the immortal elf, the humans would spend almost a century carving the citadel of *Caer Wraidd* into the *Asgwrn Mountains*. Despite the hardship, the citadel's construction would bring prosperity and unity to the human societies. The humans would name Anfarwol the immortal elf-king of Anfang.

### 64 AO

#### **Caelum Sol Orbis is born**

Caelum Sol Orbis is born an aasimar from human parentage on the 24th day of Ascendentem in the city of Anfang. Raised by a religious family, Caelum quickly gains renown as a paladin of *Lathander*. His generosity and exploits protecting Anfang justify his rise to power in *Lathander's Church*.

### 29 AO

#### **Alberich Geboren is born**

*Alberich Geboren* is born unto Anfarwol and an unknown human consort.

### 22 AO

#### **Prima Vita Sol Orbis is born**

*Prima Vita Sol Orbis* is born on the 4th day of Niveus; Caelum's first and only child. Named *First Life* by her father, she would become the progenitor of more than thirty generations of the Sol Orbis family following Caelum's ascension. Aasimar descended from Caelum would bear his distinctive silver halo on their foreheads. This would become the symbol for the [Church of Caelum](factions#church-of-caelum).

### 0 AO

#### **The Rising**

In a bid for power, the fiend Tenebrae conducts a ritual to grow the skeleton of a colossal war machine from the very earth beneath [Discidium](locations#discidium). Flying high above the *Oratory*, Caelum watches in horror as Mundi Eversor erupts from the ground of the neighbouring region. So great is the colossus in size that it seems to rise from the horizon as it approaches. Great chunks of earth crumble away from Eversor's metallic form and rain down on what used to be Discidium. Leaving volcanic ash in its wake, Eversor begins its approach to Anfang. As Eversor takes enormous strides toward Anfang, Caelum soars across the [Altum Sea](locations#altum-sea) alongside his winged paladins to intercept the colossus.

Returning to the site where his statue now stands, mortally wounded, Caelum gives his last breath to inspire his people. His people's faith renews his body and, engulfed in a radiant inferno, Caelum ascends to deliver a final blow to Eversor. The [resonance engine](getting-started#resonance-engines) within Eversor explodes, releasing the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma) from its corpse. The resulting magical shock wave enchants the deposits of [resonite](getting-started#resonance-engines) in the earth and the [earthmotes](getting-started#earthmotes) begin to rise. As a fissure opens up around Caelum's city, he stands at its centre and raises his wings. A mighty golden shield grows around the city, holding back the Miasma as [Fundus](locations#fundus) rises into the sky.

Once the turmoil subsides, Caelum releases the shield and falls to his knees, having expended the last of his energy. Caelum's body erupts into a coruscation of light, and he ascends to divinity. The city is renamed [Caelum's Landing](locations#caelums-landing) in recognition of their saviour. This event is known as the *Rising*. It should be noted, however, that this is only what is written in the chronicles of the Church of Caelum. As more and more adventurers brave the Miasma in search of new lands to settle, strange stone pillars are being discovered which seem to hold chapters of another story.

The Church sends an expeditionary force to Mallia to ascertain its eligibility for colonisation. The expedition is met by a tribe of "Reptilian people with snakes for hair." These were *Medusae*, the warriors of the Mallian queen, [Vasilissa](characters#vasilissa), capable of turning those who meet their gaze to stone.

#### **Creed's Hollow arrives in Fio**

With the imps defeated, monks of the Spirit Temple are able to arrest the earthmote and attend to its displaced denizens. The Church's ambassadors are met by a village of tiefling farmers who, until recently, had been living in seclusion in Avernus, free of *Zariel*'s rule. Creed's Hollow enjoys healthy relations with the Church and trades in agricultural produce native to the Nine Hells.

#### **Madanau is attacked by fiends**

An earthmote of deteriorated black rock emerges from the Miasma to the west as if torn from *Avernus* and thrown by *Zariel* herself. The earthmote casts a menacing shadow over Madanau, raining down ash and bloodthirsty fiends. The citizens of Madanau are quickly rushed to shelters while clerics from the Church fight back the imp invaders. Monks from the Spirit Temple are dispatched to arrest the rogue earthmote as it passes over Madanau. Flying their gliders in a circular formation, the monks produce a magical golden shield that dwarfs the earthmote in size. The monks are able to arrest and stabilise the earthmote, but not before a shard of hellish rock skewers the oasis at Madanau's centre like a stake through its heart.

Though the imps are defeated and Madanau saved, the oasis' source, a portal to the elemental plane of water, remains damaged to this day. Blights of tainted water and spoiled fish lead many of Madanau's citizens to leave and seek refuge on Caelum's Landing. Despite this, those who choose to remain have developed an unparalleled community and work ethic. With help from the [Dawnroot druids](factions#dawnroot-druids), the citizens of the ancient desert earthmote are able to stabilise the portal and develop measures to prevent or mitigate future blights.
