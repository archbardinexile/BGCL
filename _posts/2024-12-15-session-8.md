title: Session 8 They're Not Piratesâ€”Part 2
---

While the pirate captain is distracted by Arti's threat, Firien stands to engage him. The dragonborn's flail digs into his side. Furious, the captain unleashes a flurry of slashes with scimitar and dagger which Firien dodges with some urgency. With a face full of soot, Guy stows his damaged pistol and whips out his rapier, slicing his belt in the process. His breeches fall down, revealing some rather luxurious bloomers in which the dogs quickly take an interest. Gomruss is quick to slow the dogs with a ray of frost, freezing one of the dogs' hind legs.

Swashbuckling with one of the pirates, Blythe focuses her attention on the pirate captain, marking him for her next attack. That's when two menacing mechanical hands emerge from the fog and claw down the pirate captain's back. Enraged, Arti yanks the screaming captain into the fog, frightening the surrounding pirates!
