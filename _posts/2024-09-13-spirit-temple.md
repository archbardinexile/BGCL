title: The Spirit Temple (Faction)
---

The Spirit Temple monks seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue [earthmotes](exploration#earthmotes) and send them back into the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma). They have an agreement with the [Church](church-of-caelum) that enables them to serve alongside expeditions and help prevent natural disasters.
