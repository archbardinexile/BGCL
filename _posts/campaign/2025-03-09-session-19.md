title: Session 19 Where the River Flows
---

The *Six of Steel* arrive at *The Hearty Tankard* to find it bustling with lunchtime patrons. **Gomruss** first approaches the snoozing drunken half-elf at the bar. Much to the drunkard's surprise, the dragonborn confidently hands over the ***20 gold*** he owes. The drunkard tips his hat in thanks then returns to his slumber. Gomruss then spies the debt collector from Ruby sat beside two cronies at the River table in the corner. However, before Gomruss can approach, he is waylaid by *Bilziver Boldcrag*, the angry farmer whose wheat he crushed in the battle with the pteranodons. Fortunately, **Firien** is able to deliver some expert financial advice to placate him.

Approaching the River table, Gomruss overhears one of the thugs boasting about how he beat up *Snicker Nickelfoot* for easy money. Gomruss recognises the name from the local paper: the gnome miner campaigning for better safety measures in the *Resonant Mines* after allegedly seeing a miner fall to their death. The debt collector spots Gomruss and offers him a seat. Gomruss explains how he believes there has been a mistake. He shows the debt collector his paperwork and claims he only ordered 500 Dice Monarchs sets instead of 5000. The man from Ruby examines Gomruss' paperwork.

> "I'm afraid it's your word against theirs, darling. Either way it has nothing to do with me; I have a reputation to uphold."

> "Worth your life?"

> *Firien intimidates the debt collector.*

The debt collector has to renew his composure as Firien glares with the fury of Bahamut. An idea then forms on the corners of his lips, causing them to curl up. Gomruss, Firien and **Bantonio** agree to a game of Dice Monarchs on the condition that they play in a zone of truth. **Arti** assumes the role of bouncer while **Guy** and **Blythe** find a spot where they can spy on the thugs' hands.

> "I'll front the cash for your debt if... you can beat me in a game of Dice Monarchs. I'll even let your friends play."
>
> "You're on!"
>
> *Gomruss accepts the challenge.**

The man from Ruby takes the first pot with a high turn. It appears the debt collector has the upper hand until Firien cuts him down to size, stealing the next pot with a low flop. As they gamble, Bantonio attempts to elicit some empathy from the debt collectors but receives only snide criticisms about his optimism in return. After several tense hands, only Gomruss and the debt collector remain in the game. Gomruss meets the debt collector's gaze and calls his bluff. The dragonborn clears out the debt collector with double 9s!
