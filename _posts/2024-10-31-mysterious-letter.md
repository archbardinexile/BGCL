47 Larch Peak, Tenebrae's Refuge. 996, Niveus 6th.

Dear Mother,

I hope you are well. The First Life festival turned out to be a welcome break from my usual duties. Until recently I had not thought the other heralds capable of making such merry. I must admit to conspiring with Mercy to convince the heralds to join the revelry, as I wished to meet Camren for a second time. We shared drinks and he spoke of a promotion which would mean us working more closely together. Perhaps it was the mead, but I found my cheeks warmed slightly at the thought. Only a month ago I considered leaving just as Vespera did, but more recently my friends have quashed my loneliness and I have begun to appreciate the peace and quiet that comes with my role. I have decided to remain at the Oratory at least until new opportunities present themselves. I am headed to the Dawnroot Forest tomorrow morning to cleanse the statue of Caelum. I hope to see Falvalor again and tell him the good news.

P.S. Thank you for the scarf, the Oratory gets really cold this time of year.
