### Quests

##### **Debt Collectors attack Gomruss**

- 2-4 ***Thugs*** attack Gomruss when they find him.
- Thugs use ***Pack tactics.*** Unarmed strikes only unless the party retaliates with a weapon or magic.

Mission given by Doom. Capture a Basilisk using an Imprison Creature scroll.

##### **Beckonhand's Treasure**

*Silas*, *Kurt*'s adopted nephew, came to the lighthouse to discover Kurt creating a will. Silas sees Kurt has written a puzzle for *Cade*, his son, as a clue to the whereabouts of his treasure. Solving the puzzle, Silas decides to rewrite the will, sending his cousin into a trap while he goes to find the real treasure. He then pushes Kurt out of the lighthouse window.

The fake will points to the *Dawnroot Forest* where a snake pit trap waits for Cade. *Dawnroot Druids* could aid his escape. The real will pointed to a cave on *Little Nox*, where Kurt has stashed 1000 gold worth of whiskey. Silas will be angry at the lack of treasure. However, 6000 gold lies in a chest beneath the whiskey.

- Interrogating Silas will reveal his resentment of Cade. Living and caring for a broken Kurt drove Silas to madness.
- If accused, Silas may answer "Why would I kill him if I wasn't in the will?" He shouldn't know there was a will.
- Silas may become restless if the will is not delivered to Cade and go to Little Nox to collect the treasure.
- If discovered at Little Nox, Silas will claim to be visiting the spot where he and Kurt went fishing.

##### **Find Naal Berevan**

- **Blythe** may speak with *Patrocinor Mors*, the Grand Herald. Blythe will need to ***persuade*** him to reveal that **Naal** joined the *Inquisition*
  - Naal was picked for an undercover mission due to his closeness with *Camren*. Patrocinor was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused.
- Blythe may speak with Camren, deputy minister of Tenebrae's Refuge, who will acknowledge a friendship with Naal but deny involvement in his disappearance.
  - Camren leads the Crosscut Circle on Tenebrae's Refuge.
- If able to search Naal or Camren's quarters, Blythe may find correspondence that points to a meeting place in the mines on Tenebrae's Refuge. A *Crosscut Circle* symbol may appear both on the letters and at the meeting place.
- The Crosscut Circle may kidnap Blythe if her snooping proves a hindrance.
  - Camren may try to recruit Blythe and test her resolve by ordering her to deface the statue of Caelum.
