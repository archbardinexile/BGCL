### Quests and Encounters

### Rogue Automata

Warforged miners at the Resonite Processing Plant malfunction and sabotage the factory equipment. They have been reprogrammed by a union member in order to prevent warforged stealing miners' jobs in the Resonant Mines.

- 6-8 **Warforged Soldiers CR 3.** On charge while in alcove. Soulless Automata unlike Arti.
- 2 **Warforged Soldiers CR 4.** AC +2. Immune to fire damage.

- **Steel Defender.** 37 HP. Bludger, Zephan's assistant.

### Find Naal Berevan

Naal was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Constable *Denover*'s proposal to send in his own undercover agent was refused so he couldn't interfere.

- The Crosscut Circle may kidnap **Blythe** if her snooping proves a hindrance.
  - Camren may try to recruit Blythe and test her resolve by ordering her to deface the statue of Caelum.
  - The Crosscut Circle intend to steal a submarine being transported from Ingenium to Fundus. They wish to use this to recover the body of Tenebrae (Arzhang).

### Clear the Haunted Mine

The party may choose to assist *Lenna Madizos* in clearing out the Haunted Mine.

- **Will-o'-Wisp CR 2.** Vulnerable to radiant, thunder and lightning damage and turn undead. ***Consume Terror.*** Will-o'-wisp creates a terrifying illusion as a bonus action. On failed DC 10 WIS save, target is ***frightened*** and will-o'-wisp gains 3d4 hit points.

### Capture a Basilisk

A mission issued to the Commission by the Church of Caelum. Capture a Basilisk using an Imprison Creature scroll. The Church may be harvesting basilisk venom in preparation as tensions rise again with Mallia.

- Travel to 2d12 location by glider or airship.
- **Basilisk CR 2.** ***Bite.*** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d6+2 piercing + 2d6 poison.
- **Young Basilisk CR 1.** ***Bite.*** +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d4+1 piercing + 1d4 poison.
- Players must be careful of *petrifying gaze*

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry cannot confirm the existence of the fallen miner as there is no paper trail. Therefore the implementation of better health and safety in the mines is on hold. The miner who fell was in fact an illusion created by an agent of the *Mining Consortium* in order to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from *Micantrum* instead of the *Garnetgrinder Clan*.

- Snicker Nickelfoot is in the mining village on the Resonant Mines.
- Gerti Garnetgrinder despises that she comes from a banking family, but does not speak ill of her parents.

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* is offering work clearing out a buried tomb in Os Terrae. The airship to Arx won't depart until Darshan has finished his work at Crowswood Place.
