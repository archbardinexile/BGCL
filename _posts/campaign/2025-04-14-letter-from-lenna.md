> Hey Yrevi,
>
> Sorry for not writing sooner, I saw your picture in the paperâ€”Congratulations on winning the New Blood tournament! I'm so proud of you, I would have loved to watch you but I've only just returned from the Manyshells. We were recently recalled without explanation. I suspect politics is involved.
>
> Can we meet up soon? I'd love to meet the Six of Steel! I'm currently staying at the chapel on Tenebrae's Refuge. I had the pleasure of cleaning up your mess in the mine! I hope those wisps didn't give you too much trouble. I'm between assignments at the moment so maybe I could come to you? Write to me or use my sending sigil.
>
> Love, Lenna
