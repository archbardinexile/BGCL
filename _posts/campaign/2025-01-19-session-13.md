title: Session 13 An Audience with the Exarch
---

### Crowswood Place

The *Six of Steel* return to *Crowswood Place* with bellies full and trophies in hand. *Clara* and *Corvus* congratulate the party while *Adelaide* beckons **Arti** to her office. She requests Arti help proofread her blood magic proposal and deliver it to the Exarch upon completion. **Firien** asks Clara if she is ready to see *Aura*. When the young *Sol Orbis* nods, **Bantonio** hurriedly puts on his best attire. **Guy** invites himself along, intent on seeing *Ingenium* from atop the *Oratory*'s spire. **Blythe** too claims to have business at the Oratory and **Gomruss**, despite nursing a roiling stomach, decides to join them. The party bid Arti farewell and head for the Oratory with Clara in tow.

### The Oratory

Arriving in the early evening, the party are greeted by Dean *Vance*, Firien's assigned tutor. Firien explains they are here to see Aura and—upon spying Clara amongst them—the Dean retreats to the private chambers to summon the Exarch. Blythe separates from the group to study her notes while Guy makes for the staircase. Guy reaches the balcony atop the spire and extends his telescope to observe the earthmote *Ingenium* from afar. Even from this distance Guy can see the bright orange glow of Ingenium's grand forges. Enormous chimneys vent opaque plumes of steam at the centre of the sprawling brass metropolis; perhaps this was his ticket in, unseen.

Downstairs, Aura's boots echo against the marble floor tiles; she sports the majestic white armour of a paladin. The halo on her forehead contrasts with her warm-tinted brown skin and her long afro-textured hair is gathered in golden bands. She sets her solid white eyes on Firien, who explains they are here to support Clara. Clara emerges from behind Firien somewhat gingerly. With some words of inspiration from Bantonio, Clara finds the courage to tell Aura she no longer wants to be Prefect of Tenebrae's Refuge.

> "Why didn't you tell me?"
>
> "Because duty was always so important to you... and because I didn't know any better a year ago. There are people who deserve the job way more than I do—people who are respected not for their blood but for their character."
>
> "Would it not be better for the people to see a Sol Orbis living life freely, than to watch another run off, never to be seen again?"
>
> *Firien touches a nerve.*

Aura seems to shrink at the mention of *Vespera Sol Orbis*. Blythe's ear's prick up, recognising the name from *Naal*'s letter. Firien steps forward. They suggest that freeing Clara of her responsibilities would not only be the right choice morally, but it would also help to improve public opinion of the Church, notorious for its nepotism. Aura asks the party for their opinion of the Church. Bantonio summons the courage to step forward and declare his faith in Caelum.

> "I didn't even know there were other gods until I arrived on Caelum's Landing!"
>
> "This is troubling. It is important to me that the people of the Relief are free to worship whomever they wish."
>
> *Bantonio to Aura.*

Bantonio explains how his faith was challenged but ultimately renewed when he discovered the existence of the *Inquisition*, the Church's secret police. He spies Aura glancing to a tapestry of Caelum's many conquests on the far wall. Sensing the Exarch is troubled, Bantonio boldly asks Aura if her faith has ever faltered.

> "When I was young I began to question my father's expansionist practices. I can only assume it was his interpretation of Caelum's teachings that led him down such a dark path. I can only hope my example will help lead my family and future generations down the path of light."
>
> *Aura confides in Bantonio.*

Aura agrees to release Clara from her responsibilities as Prefect, stating that she does so not for public approval but because it's what's best for Clara. The young Sol Orbis wraps her arms around the Exarch and squeezes! Aura returns the hug with a smile and Bantonio begins a round of applause. Guy returns just in time to join in. While Clara thanks Firien with a hug, Bantonio requests a blessing from the Exarch. Aura is happy to oblige and gently draws a circle on the Bantonio's forehead with her thumb.

***Bantonio gains the effect of Bless until the end of the day.***
