## **Negative Mass**

*6th-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gold ingot)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You invert the curvature of spacetime around a creature of your choice within range, creating a 5-foot-radius invisible sphere of anti-gravity. The sphere moves with the creature, centred on it. For the duration, the target has a +5 bonus to AC and it takes no damage from arrows, *thrown* weapons (when thrown) or *magic missile*.

In addition, objects (including weapons) that weigh up to 4 lb. within the area of effect are pushed 10 feet away from the target by the spell's effect. Unsecured objects are pushed automatically. If the object is carried by a creature, that creature must make a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) to keep hold of it. When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
