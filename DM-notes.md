## **Manyshells**

### Anchorheart's Folly

> *Lenna Madizos* discovered the Church was requisitioning basilisk venom in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia. *Subira* tracked the venom to Rose Merryn’s Pre-Loved Goods in *Runnelstone*.

> *Elyse* asked *Rose* to smuggle basilisk venom as part of her investigation. Rose and Subira were captured by *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* when his fleet attacked Runnelstone. Rose's shop and the venom were destroyed.

> The venom was purchased by *Jeremias Blackflight* and hidden from the exarchy. Now his insurance broker, *Bertrand Magnier* won't pay up.

Anchorheart has bound a powerful water elemental to his ship, the *Umberlee's Wrath*. It can shroud his fleet in fog. The 6oS have enlisted the help of *Daniel*, a meteorologist and member of the *Society of Brilliance*. Using sending buoys, *DAV3* can track the elemental's movements inside *Killigrew Mor*.

Anchorheart ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. He offers the Queen gemlock weapons, in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the *Manyshells*. The destruction of the venom was ordered by Queen *Vasilissa*, in league with Anchorheart.

### Sullivanwick

*Faust Blackflight* discovered the dead drop and learned that *Thibault Duchamp* (T) sent resonite from the bank's vault to the *Crosscut Circle* via the *Arxman*. When he heard that Anchorheart was planning to attack *Sullivanwick*, he engaged Anchorheart and claimed the submarine was almost finished. Anchorheart then changed tack south-west to intercept the Githzechi ships.

Faust will bring sandwiches to the meeting and play along. He will try to find out what Blythe (V) knows. If discovered, he will offer the services of his ship, the *Lady Firehair*. The 6oS may be able to reach the Crosscut Circle before Anchorheart.

> "It's the ship that made the Tamar run in less than 12 fathoms."
>
> *Faust.*

### Before the storm

Anchorheart will intercept the Githzechi ships on ***Flavum 7th*** and follow them to *Farwest Archipelago*. Umberlee's Wrath will arrive on ***Flavum 10th*** and attack.

- ***If luring Anchorheart*** with promise to exchange gemlock rifle, require persuasion check
  - If successful, Anchorheart will arrive first with the Wrath, Rose and Subira hidden as collateral
  - If unsuccessful, 6oS must track Umberlee's Wrath to Farwest Archipelago

- ***If following Umberlee's Wrath*** in visual range, require stealth check
  - If discovered, Umberlee's Wrath will teleport and board the Marley/Lady Firehair
  - If successfully followed, Anchorheart must do stealth check to follow the Githzechi ships
    - Anchorheart will bombard Farwest Archipelago and attempt to take the Crosscut Circle base
    - Githzechi ships may successfully repel Anchorheart if not attacked beforehand
    - If Crosscut Circle are warned, the submarine will have already left

- ***If Guy chooses to join Anchorheart*** he must hand over the rifle and help attack the Crosscut Circle
- ***If Guy refuses to join Anchorheart*** he will threaten to kill:
  - Rose and Subira (if lured)
  - Elyse (if boarded)

*ABC* is aboard Umberlee's Wrath posing as the powder monkey. She can sabotage the weapons.

*Elyse* will overrule a decision to attack the Wrath without support.

- Elyse will successfully garner *Free Trade Navy* support—the ships won't arrive until ***Flavum 13th***
- Guy may garner immediate Church/CSCA support if he successfully persuades Magnier

### Project Abyss

> *Naal* was picked by *Tristis* to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his relationship with *Camren de Villeneuve*. Camren has been arrested. Naal and *Vetra Bery* now assemble the stolen submarine in the *Farwest Archipelago* with help from *Githzechi* engineers.

Vetra wants to recover the body of Tenebrae (*Arzhang*) from *Mundi Eversor* in the *Vena Trench*. She intends to revive him and prove that Caelum created the Miasma. The submarine may be attacked by triton from *Abyssus* on its journey.

The 6oS cannot reveal that the body inside Mundi Eversor is not Tenebrae, lest they break their oath.

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

> Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

Lighting the candles creates a portal to a corridor of mirrors presenting infinite destinations. The 6oS may have to fight their duplicates to continue.

- The Arx expedition can be seen trapped in a sandstone maze demiplane.
  - 6oS must guide them out while battling mirror mephits.
  - Darkhalijz, the spirit cloak worn by Xander Coppermane, tells how the staff from his collection banishes enemies to the mirror plane. To escape they must find and destroy it.
- Chance can be seen trapped in a giant hourglass on an infinite chequerboard.

River Chapman will trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane. Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the 6oS must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

> *Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

> *Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines.

Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

> The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
10. Caelum ascends to divinity, leaving Ten to activate the pillars and shield the relief.
