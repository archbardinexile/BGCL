title: Session 57 House of Steel
---

While **Arti** invests in several uncommon potions, *Morxalim* asks **Gomruss** to sign their custom Dice Monarchs set for luck! *Fenton* then invites the *Six of Steel* to witness a rehearsal of the *Pompous Piper's Extravaganza*, scheduled to appear in *Anchora* in three days. Fenton takes centre stage as ringmaster and introduces his crew of daring acrobats, extraordinary bodybuilders and witty jesters. After a fun-filled evening, the party bid farewell to the Piper's crew and retire with a catchy tune in their heads.

***The party gains advantage on Charisma checks for 24 hours.***

## **996, Flavum 6th**

### Diamond Palace

**Bantonio** awakens to find his nose buried in his absent lover's hair. The familiar scent brings him comfort as she stirs. Queen *Carina* tightens her embrace on him and murmurs something about staying in bed. Though the feeling is mutual, *Rodrigo Santiago* must remind her of her forthcoming duties. For a moment, Carina questions the morality of their relationship, given her betrothal to *Rafael de Florencia*, the future patriarch of a noble family. In reply, Rodrigo considers the life they might have should they elope together. The songbirds at the open window flee when Rafael bursts into the room! Rodrigo steps in front of Carina to protect her.

> "Rafael, wait! We were only doing what's in our hearts."
>
> "You should learn to control your heart, Santiago. Not to mention your libido. You're not worthy of my sword."
>
> "Funny, your fiancée says the same of you."
>
> *Rodrigo destroys Rafael.*

Rafael draws his rapier in anger, prompting Rodrigo to reply in kind. Despite Carina's protests, their swords clash in a dance of petty rivalry! Rafael is the first to parry, finding an opening to tear Rodrigo's shirt. The pair continue to trade blows until Rodrigo performs a disarming attack! The clumsy riposte slices into Rafael's forearm. The would-be king growls and surreptitious draws his pistol. The blast interrupts Bantonio's boasting. His fingertips find blood staining his shirt. Darkness begins to envelop his vision as he stumbles toward the window.
