It's quite a walk to the city district, on the eastern side of the Oasis. Thankfully it is largely uneventful. They arrive to find villagers banding together to repair broken housing and sweeping up debris on the streets. Outside the main church, a pagoda has been erected as a shelter for the numerous wounded.

"There's the Prefect! Come on."
Stoutmann breaks into a jog and the others follow. Though Firien had never been formally introduced to the Prefect, their reputation preceded them. They were a tall, slender aasimar with a complexion like the finest milk chocolate. Their straight white hair was brushed back and held in a ponytail by a simple blue ribbon. The flowing robes they wore were also very simple, belying their status as Prefect.
"Prefect!"
The Prefect turns from supervising a healing taking place. Their eyes were icy blue and glowed like the brightest stars. Yet they remained half-lidded as if they were perpetually sleepy.
"Stoutmann. I'm glad to see you're alright."
"I have a report for you, ma'am."
"Proceed."
As Stoutmann delivers his report, Firien's eyes are drawn to the marking on the Prefect's forehead. A halo. A simple glowing white ring perhaps the size of a plum. The mark was unmistakable. This halo was commonly associated with the Sol Orbis family; the ruling family of Caelum's Landing and heirs to Caelum himself.
"I see. You have done very well, Stoutmann. Thank you. You and your acolytes please report to Kaley inside, she is overseeing the healing effort here."
"Yes ma'am. I would ask that Firien join us too, ma'am."
The Prefect's eyes turn on Firien.
"Is what Stoutmann said about you true?"

Firien instinctively straightens up as they are brought under scrutiny. There is an overbearing anxiety pressing on their shoulders all of a sudden; as if confirming the truth to the Prefect will suddenly make all of this real. Along with any consequences it might bring. But they swallow the lump in their throat and square their shoulders, turning their tension into confidence. They meet the Prefect's gaze, and it can be seen that, instead of a flicker of flame at the edges of their yellow eyes, like many dragonborn, there is a skitter of lightning.
"It's true, Prefect."

The Prefect is silent for a moment, staring into Firien's eyes as if assessing their sincerity. They nod subtly.
"Go inside, Stoutmann. Firien will join you in a moment."
"Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am."
"And please don't call me "ma'am."
"Sorry m- err... Prefect. Come on you two."
Before they head inside, Stoutmann offers Firien a nod of reassurance.
"How do you feel? Firien, wasn't it?"

"Ah- yes, Firien Madizos... A little overwhelmed, to be honest. I feel like there's lightning beneath my scales, a-and I'm worried about my parents but..."
They take a deep breath, to prevent themself from rambling, and they follow the thrum of thunder in their chest to centre their nerves, and it seems to relax them.
"But... I'm not quite as scared as I thought I'd be. Well- more like my fear is... Tempered, by what needs to be done."

The Prefect nods subtly once more.
"I will have an acolyte sent to check on your parents, and deliver the news that you are okay. Would you walk with me a moment?"

Despite the brave front they're putting up, Firien does visibly relax.
"Thank you, Prefect."
They fall into step with the Aasimar, doing their best to match the pace the Prefect sets despite Firien being quite tall.

The Prefect leads Firien away from the bustle of the pagoda and onto a quieter street where they can remain in the shade of the Church.
"The Platinum Dragon does not commonly bless his followers with divine magics such as those you displayed today. But I have learned that he is a compassionate soul. A just soul. I can only assume that your faith in him found his ears in a moment of dire need."

As Firien follows, they allow themself to think on what the Prefect is saying, and they try to formulate in their mind an explanation, or even just a feeling.
"Bahamut doesn't really attach himself to words or objects. I put my faith in him into my everyday deeds; the work I do at home, the ways I can help my neighbours. When the imps started swarming... Well, it was no question. I had to do something."

The Prefect pauses and turns to Firien, offering the subtlest of smiles.
"Encouraging words. I would hope that your heart remains so kind and humble as you acclimate to your newfound power... and responsibility."
They continue walking.
"In circumstances such as this it is protocol that the Church offer tutelage to help you understand and hone your skills as a cleric. I would understand should you wish to refuse, but I urge you not to. You... may find yourself under the Church's scrutiny."

Firien nods in understanding.
"I... I don't want to be alone in this. It feels right, but that doesn't mean it isn't also terrifying."

"Thank you for your honesty. You should speak with your parents about all this, of course. When you're ready, I will submit a request for you to attend the Church on Caelum's Landing as an acolyte. And... I will of course stress that your faith lies with Bahamut. If there's anything you need, you can come to see me."

With a deep breath that seems to relieve their body of no small amount of tension, Firien looks at the Aasimar with an expression that betrays both their youth and their emotions.
"Thank you, Prefect. I would... Like to help still, if you'll permit it. The strength, the healing... It's felt intuitive so far."

"If you feel you can, that would be appreciated. Go and speak with Stoutmann, I'm sure he'll have some jobs for you. My name is Sana, by the way."

A young acolyte runs through the streets of Madanau with butterflies in his stomach. Thankfully not literally. It wasn't uncommon for the young earth genasi to attract butterflies with the vibrant flowers peeking out of his short, spiked hair. The damage was severe in places, but thankfully not widespread. The all clear bell had been sounded and the citizens had left the shelters to begin repairs. It was encouraging to see such mechanical teamwork from Madanau's community. And it was a pillar of that community the young acolyte was trying to find.

While the absolute worst is over, things are still chaotic in places, though mitigated by the people banding together to start the arduous task of cleaning up. And it is as the young acolyte is observing the joint effort that he finally spots something that might be what he's looking for.
"Is that all of them?"
"It is, Miss Bixi. At least all the bits that weren't smashed."
"Oh don't worry, it should be more than enough. Now..."
The dramatic green glint is the first thing that catches the genasi's eye, and it comes from the centre plating of this dragonborn's crest. She steps back from the broken down wall of a house the locals have done their best to reconstruct, and brings her hands up. She's wearing what look like simple, comfortable robes with... A frilly white apron over the top?
"Inhelk Slemon."
Vibrant orange magics start to sprout from the spaces between the reconstructed stonework, shaping the stone back into the wall it once was. This is powerful transmutation magic.

"Here you are, my love."
Another brass dragonborn, heavier set with a handsome jawline and chamfered crest, wheels a barrow of replacement stones to his partner.

"Ah, Thank you Lorento. Just set them there my love, the others can start putting them where they're needed."
"Ah, excuse me?"
As the genasi acolyte approaches, Bixi snaps her fingers, and the wall solidifies. It's almost like it never got knocked down. She then turns to the genasi, her deep reddish snout glinting a little as she smiles.
"Ah, hello, do you need any help?"

"You are erm... Bixi and Lorento Madizos, right? Parents of Firien?"
"Firien? Are they alright?"
"Y-yes. Well erm... sort of. They're at the church. They're unharmed but... something has happened that the Prefect would like to speak with you about."

"The Prefect?"
Bixi stands up straight, and her tail straightens behind her in alarm. It only takes a moment before she turns around, points the people stacking stones to the work they need to be doing, then turns right back around.
"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!"

Firien seems... In a surprisingly good mood, actually. With some direction from Stoutmann, they have been flitting about the church, helping where they are asked, usually through practical means as they only have a small amount of magic to spare. But that doesn't mean that there isn't some healing to be done.
"Winida."
With a gentle word, a shimmer of platinum weaves its way through torn fabric and loose seams, pulling thread back into place and buttons back into line. The shimmer fades with a puff, and Firien hands the teddy bear back to the child in front of them.
"There we are, all better again."

The young blue tiefling snatches her horned teddy bear back up and squeezes it tight.
"What do you say, Tilly?"
"Thank you!"
"Good girl. Thank you."
"Can I touch your nose?"
"Tilly..."

"Haha I don't mind."
Firien kneels down so the little girl can reach them. It makes the orange tips of their impressive crown of horns glint in the light coming through the windows.

The little tiefling reaches out a stubby hand to gently stroke Firien's snout. She giggles.
"It feels nice!"
Embarrassed, she snatches her hand away and wiggles, burying her face in her teddy.
"Doctor!"
Firien looks to the entrance of the church where two villagers are carrying another between them. Kaley, the local dwarf surgeon leading the healing effort, rushes up to them.
"What happened?"
"Bunch of imps got into the generator, blew it apart."
"He's bleeding a lot."
"Any free hands get me a stretcher, bring him inside."

Firien looks up, hears what's happening, and with one last reassuring smile to the girl they stand and start to move. They join the effort to pick up a stretcher and make their way over to Kaley.

They find themselves looking across the stretcher to Terry, lifting it from the other side. He offers a shy half-smile of recognition. Kaley and the villager help the engineer onto the stretcher and the four carry him inside.
"Set him down here."
Kaley directs them to a mattress on the marble floor. It was easier for the dwarf to get at her patient from here.
"Help me cut away his clothes."
Terry fetches a pair of scissors and Kaley cuts away the bloodstained fabric. The engineer was peppered with tiny lacerations across his right side.
"Ahh Moradin. Alright we can't seal the wounds until we know if there's any shrapnel left inside."
Firien feels something very strange. A tingling in their fingers. There were indeed metal shards in the man's body. The electricity still dancing over Firien's scales was tugging at them. To find out exactly how deep the shards of metal were, all they would have to do is run their hand over the engineer's chest.
"How big was the blast?"
"Pretty big. Thankfully we dodged the bulk of it."

The sensation makes Firien stiffen up for a moment, but once they focus on it and try to understand its meaning, they relax again. Knowing hesitation isn't an option, Firien steps over and kneels in a space next to both the surgeon and her patient.
"I can sense the metal. I could pinpoint them, if I may come closer?"
Firien holds their hand out to demonstrate to Kaley the faint sparks of electricity harmlessly bouncing between their scales.

Kaley cocks an eyebrow. Her eyes dart between Firien and the sparks at their fingertips.
"Alright kid, knock yourself out."
Floating their hand gently over the man's torso, Firien feels what they would imagine it feels like to have their hairs stand on end. Their scales bristle when their palm finds shards of metal close to the skin. They could find four shards in total, one a little deeper than the others. Then, a clink!
"Something nipped me!"
Kaley looks a little closer at Firien's hand. One of the shards had magnetically attached itself to Firien's palm.

"Hah! You're a walking magnet. Terry, get me some tweezers would you?"
Terry quickly returns with a pair of metal tweezers and hands them to Kaley, who promptly hands them to Firien.
"Alright, kid... this is gonna be easier if you do it. Keep the tweezers closed when you go in, and just let your erm... natural magnetism do the rest."

They blink slightly as they accept the tweezers.
"Uh- right, I got this."
To Firien's credit, they are very careful. To keep their hand calm and steady, they try to think of it not as sticking pokey bits into a person, and more like... Precision decoration of a cake. A careful, exacting process they have done time and time again. This keeps them focused as the next two shards come out with startling ease. They pull away each time, remove the shard from their scales, and lean back over. When they lean over the third time, they take a deep breath.
"Alright... There's one left, but it's a little deeper than the others."

"You've got this, Firien."
With the practised skill of a cake decorator, Firien slowly but surely lowers the tweezers into the wound. After what feels like the longest eight seconds in Firien's life, they feel a snap as the shard magnetically attaches to the tweezers. With the same steady hand motions, Firien eases the tweezers out of the wound, and the shrapnel comes away with only a minor hiss from the engineer.
"Excellent work, kid. Alright Terry, go ahead."
With a nod, the young acolyte's hands glow with light, and the engineer's wounds quickly heal over.
"Not bad for a baker."

"Haha I mean, baking can be very delicate business."
Firien sets the tweezers down and accepts the opportunity to clean their hands when it is offered. They breathe a quiet sigh of relief to themself.

"You know, I just realised we've never been formally introduced. Name's Kaley Coldhands, I work with your parents at the Civic."
Kaley offers what is indeed a cold hand to shake.

By contrast, Firien's hand is hot to the touch, not uncomfortably so, but definitely hotter than even when Kaley has shaken their parents' hands in the past.
"Oh, really? I don't tend to ask about their Civic work. Not unless they want to talk about it themselves."

"It's nothing glamorous... tax rates, work shifts, best time for selling buns, that sort of thing."
"Firien!"
Stoutmann appears at the doors.
"Your folks have arrived."
"Huh, speak of the devil."

"Oh! Already?"
Firien straightens up with but a slight stumble, and follows back out the doors. Outside, Bixi takes a deep inhale, and she shivers slightly.
"I smell magical lightning alright. It kinda leaves behind a vibration in the air... makes my teeth feel funny-"
"Mum, dad!"
"Ooh there's my baby!"
It takes all of a second for Bixi to immediately steal Firien for a big squish around their midsection the moment they're in reach, and Firien nearly topples over from the momentum. Evidently they take after their father in terms of height.
"Haha I'm okay!"

"Woah! Ease up, love, you're going to break the kid."
Lorento joins the two, placing a large hand on both their backs, keeping them close.
"How you feeling, Yrevi?"

Bixi is content to stay squishing, but loosens up a little bit. Firien looks up to their dad with a smile.
"I'm okay, I really am. A little overwhelmed. How... How much have you been told?"

"This young lad told us you'd started shooting lightning out your hands. That the clerics think that you-"
Their father's eyes flash down to the pendant around their neck.
"That you've been gifted divine power."

Firien catches this, and with a gentle hand on her shoulder, they step back from Bixi. They take hold of the pendant and look up to the sky, and though the storm cloud is no longer there, they can still feel the electric shadow of its presence.
"I know how it sounds... But it's true. It's the only explanation, I- I pulled lightning from the sky, and healed a man's wounds, all on instinct. I was... I was heard."
As they curl their hand around their pendant, a skitter of lightning jumps between the scales of their fingers, and Bixi tilts her head. She brings her hand to wrap around Firien's in turn, closing her eyes and feeling... Then she opens them again and grins.
"I feel it. I can feel the magic making currents in your very being—but it's not like mine, it's not arcane."

"Divine magic."
Lorento shakes his head in disbelief.
"Firien, this is wonderful! Bahamut actually heard you."
The young earth genasi scampers away to go and find the Prefect.

"Hah! No wonder my arcane lessons didn't take! It was the universe saying back off, this one's meant for greater things!"
Bixi reaches up to squish Firien's cheeks.

"So... what happens now?"
"Firien has a choice to make, Mister Madizos."
The three turn to see the Prefect approaching, their floral assistant in tow.
"It's good to meet you both. Would you allow me a moment of your time?"

All eyes turn to Sana, and Bixi's go a little wide... But then she and Lorento see Firien smile a little at the Prefect's arrival. They look at their parents and nod.
"Of course, Prefect."

Sana bows their head a little in respect.
"Thank you. We can speak in my study."
Sana leads the trio into the Church and through to one of the private chambers. Inside is a cosy library, complete with padded armchairs, stationery, and even a layered glass map of Fio. The window is the only wall that doesn't have a bookshelf.
"Please, take a seat. Would you like anything to drink? Tea perhaps?"

As they wander inside, Bixi immediately starts to look around with energy.
"So many books!"
"I would like a cup of tea. It might calm nerves a bit more."

"That's very kind, thank you."
Lorento gives Bixi a subtle elbow. Sana nods.
"Halli?"
"I'm on it!"
With a tip of the flowers, the earth genasi wanders off to the kitchens. Sana settles in their chair opposite the dragonborn.
"I realise this must have come as quite a shock for all of you, and you must take some time to think on my proposal of course. The Church would like to offer Firien the training they need to become a tempest Cleric. They would be required to attend the Church on Caelum's Landing as a... provisional acolyte. They would be given adequate accommodation and, most importantly, they would be in an environment where they could worship Bahamut openly."
