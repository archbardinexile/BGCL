## **Session 25 (996, Roscidas 21th)**

### Investigate the Submarine

The *Six of Steel* and *Agnes* investigate the docks where the submarine is being constructed. *Loronath Highbrow Muthalavea*, a well-dressed goliath, offers a tour of *Project Abyss* facility. He thanks Vetra Bery who saved the project when its funding requirements increased. As the primary stakeholders, the CSCA have demanded the project be extended to include military applications.

The submarine is a second generation deep-sea exploration vehicle designed to explore the *Vena Trench*. The first submarine was attacked by triton from *Abyssus* in 990 PO. Plans for a second expedition to the Vena Trench will take the submarine close to the carcass of Mundi Eversor. The map for the expedition was drawn by *Giovanni Santiago*.

Investigating may reveal a list of the project's sponsors:
  - Combe Shipping and Courier Agency
  - Ingenium Inventors Association
  - Caelum's Landing University
  - Oghma Archive
  - Verbatim Foundation (Vetra Bery)
  - Nemo Systems
  - Cryptic Aviation
  - Shadoworks

Snooping will uncover a list of candidates for the crew of the expedition. Some of the candidates have been crossed out. A pirate, *Wesley* is also snooping for the submarine's blueprints. If discovered, the pirate will shoot a hidden pistol and flee.

If questioned:
- Loronath knows nothing about the Crosscut Circle. Vetra Bery is the only guest whose name begins with a V.
- Vetra will deny involvement with the Crosscut Circle. She may recognise Blythe if not in disguise.
- The pirate may reveal that he's working for *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* if successfully captured and intimidated.

### Spiro Sol Orbis

**Firien** may wish to see *Spiro Sol Orbis* before the hearing. Spiro can be found at the *Department of Justice* where an illegal protest is being led by *Harbek Goldmask*. They are demanding the release of *Ivrinn Goldmask* the saboteur. A riot may break out. Spiro's hero landing may stop the riot if Firien cannot.

### Arti's Hearing

Tristis may attempt to read Blythe's thoughts, leading to the arrest of Camren. The Inquisition may stop the submarine construction, leading the Crosscut Circle to act prematurely and steal the submarine.

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry cannot confirm the existence of the fallen miner as there is no paperwork. Therefore, the implementation of better health and safety in the mines is on hold. The union holds regular strikes.

The miner who fell was an illusion created by an agent of the *Mining Consortium* in order to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from *Micantrum* instead of the *Garnetgrinder Clan*.

- *Harbek Goldmask* has taken Snicker's place leading the union.
- *Gerti Garnetgrinder* despises that she comes from a banking family, but does not speak ill of her parents.

### Anchorheart's Folly

*Lenna Madizos* returns from clearing out Tenebrae's Refuge mine. She was recently recalled from her work providing aid to the Manyshells and has been investigating why. Her only lead is the Church requisitioning vast amounts of Basilisk oil through independent guilds so it goes unnoticed. The basilisk oil is in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia, who have warriors that can petrify with their gaze.

**Guy**'s captain, *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* ordered Guy to retrieve a resonite weapon from Caelum's Landing. Anchorheart may let Guy in on his secret. He has made a deal with Vasilissa. He offers resonite weapons and in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the Manyshells.

### Find Naal Berevan

Naal was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Constable *Denover*'s proposal to send in his own undercover agent was refused so he couldn't interfere.

- The Crosscut Circle may kidnap **Blythe** if her snooping proves a hindrance.
  - Vetra may try to recruit Blythe to join the submarine crew. They intend to mutiny and use the submarine to recover the body of Tenebrae (Arzhang).

### Capture a Basilisk

A mission issued to the Commission by the Church of Caelum. Capture a Basilisk using an Imprison Creature scroll. The Church may be harvesting basilisk venom in preparation as tensions rise again with Mallia.

- Travel to 2d12 location by glider or airship.
- **Basilisk CR 2.** ***Bite.*** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d6+2 piercing + 2d6 poison.
- **Young Basilisk CR 1.** ***Bite.*** +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d4+1 piercing + 1d4 poison.
- Players must be careful of *petrifying gaze*

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* is offering work clearing out a buried tomb in Os Terrae. The airship to Arx won't depart until Darshan has finished his work at Crowswood Place. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

Bantonio may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*.

### Confront River Chapman

Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

River Chapman may trap the party in his game room. They will face dice monsters on a chequerboard in the mirror plane.
