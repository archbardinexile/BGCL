## **Blood Hunter Order**

### Order of the Lantern

The Order of the Lantern is a clandestine organisation of *Blood Hunters* who undergo a ritual that allows them to safely navigate and research the [Miasma](lore#the-miasma). They have strong ties with the [Commission](factions#the-commission). Given the nature of your tainted blood, your DM may ask for a Constitution saving throw any time you take necrotic damage when invoking a blood curse or crimson rite. On a failed save, your level of [*psychosis*](rules#psychosis) may increase.

#### **Rite of the Dusk**

When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dusk as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of the Dusk, the extra damage dealt by your rite is poison damage. Additionally, while that rite is active on your weapon, you gain the following benefits:

- Your weapon disperses fog out to a range of 20 feet.
- You have resistance to poison damage.
- When you hit a poisoned creature with a weapon for which the Rite of the Dusk is active, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.

#### **Aberrant Gaze**

Starting at 3rd level, you can see a faint aura around poisoned creatures to a distance of 120 feet. Your sight can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. You can see poisoned creatures normally in non-magical darkness.

#### **Psychotic Rebuke**

Starting at 7th level, when you are damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to enshroud the creature that damaged you with a cloud of poisonous, purple fog. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is blinded for 1 minute and its psychosis level increases by 1. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the blinded condition ends.

#### **Purge Toxins**

Starting at 11th level, as an action, you can forcefully extract the poison from afflicted creatures you touch. Choose one of the following effects:

- A poisoned creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your spellcasting ability modifier. Any poisons afflicting the target are neutralised. If the target has a psychosis level, it is reduced by 1d4+1 and you may roll an additional hemocraft die for each level of psychosis removed when determining the number of hit points regained.

- A poisoned creature you touch takes necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your spellcasting ability modifier. Any poisons afflicting the target are neutralised. If the target has a psychosis level, it is reduced by 1d4+1 and you may roll an additional hemocraft die for each level of psychosis removed when determining the damage taken.

#### **Aberrant Gaze Improvement**

Starting at 15th level, your Aberrant Gaze can now penetrate all barriers and you can see poisoned creatures normally in magical darkness. As an action, you can gaze upon a poisoned creature within 120 feet and increase its psychosis level by 2.

#### **Blood Curse of the Miasma**

At 18th level, you gain the Blood Curse of the Miasma for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.

**Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lantern.**

Choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you that is poisoned. It takes 2d6 necrotic damage and poisonous, purple fog spills from its veins in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for 10 minutes or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the curse. Its area is heavily obscured. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 poison damage. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

**Amplify.**

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the fog up to 20 feet. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its psychosis level increases by 1.
