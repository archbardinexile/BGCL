## **Garnetgrinder's Garnet Grinder**

*2nd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral hammer within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

If the weapon hits a target made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal, the hit becomes a critical hit. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a target within 5 feet of it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
