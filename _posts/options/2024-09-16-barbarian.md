## [**Barbarian Class Features**](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#barbarian_phb)

### Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the ***Player's Handbook*** when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a barbarian. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### **Primal Form (Optional)**

Starting at 7th level, your rage now has three forms. Choose one when you first enter your rage. You can switch forms as a bonus action.

- **Attack.** You have a bonus to attack rolls equal to your rage damage bonus.
- **Defence.** You have a bonus to AC equal to your rage damage bonus.
- **Speed.** Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armour.
