## **Manyshells**

The destruction of the venom was ordered by Queen *Vasilissa*, in league with *Anchorheart*. The queen gave him a magical weapon to help him bind an Elder Tempest to his ship, the *Umberlee's Wrath*. It can shroud his fleet in fog.

Anchorheart ordered **Guy** to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. With gemlock weapons, the Mallians can invade the Manyshells and destroy the CSCA. The queen has promised Anchorheart territory.

The *Crosscut Circle* have allied with the *githzechi* to construct the submarine. Anchorheart wants to add the submarine to his fleet and equip it with gemlock weapons.

### The Siege of Farwest

The Crosscut Circle are supported by ***3 githzechi ships***. The submarine has been moved to *Pedn Vounder* using a catamaran. The submarine will be seaworthy on ***Flavum 12th***, allowing *Vetra* to escape underwater.

Traps have been laid at the submarine's previous location. Underwater spikes are ***difficult terrain*** and may ***damage (AC 15)*** or ***restrain (DC 10)*** ships. ***4d4*** piercing damage per spike (1d6).

The Wrath's crew is composed of **Pirates*** with hit points 44–68. *ABC* is aboard the Wrath posing as a powder monkey. She can sabotage its weapons if Anchorheart tries to bombard *Farwest*.

Anchorheart must make an ***intimidation check (DC 15 with pain symbol)*** to successfully interrogate the githzechi. They have not been told the new location of the submarine. Anchorheart may use the githzechi's sending stone.
- ***If no traps are revealed***, Anchorheart will send 2 small ships to pursue the *Lady Firehair* into *Farwest*.
- ***If traps are revealed***, Anchorheart will send ***Yuan-Ti Malison*** and ***Triton Shorestalkers*** to investigate. One of the Shorestalkers carries a scrying orb.
  - ***If Guy is spotted***, Anchorheart will cast sending and torture *Rose* unless Guy reveals the submarine's location.

- *Durzus*' 8 ships will arrive on 11th-12th
- *Elyse*'s airship will arrive 12th-13th
- *Elyse*'s ships will arrive on 16th-17th

### Project Abyss

*Naal* and *Vetra* want to recover the body of Tenebrae (*Arzhang*) from *Mundi Eversor* in the *Vena Trench*. They intend to conduct a ritual to revive him and prove that Caelum created the Miasma. The Six of Steel cannot reveal that the body inside Mundi Eversor is not Tenebrae, lest they break their oath.

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

> Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

Lighting the candles creates a portal to a corridor of mirrors presenting infinite destinations. The Six of Steel may have to fight their duplicates to continue.

- The Arx expedition can be seen trapped in a sandstone maze demiplane.
  - Six of Steel must guide them out while battling mirror mephits.
  - Darkhalijz, the spirit cloak worn by Xander Coppermane, tells how the staff from his collection banishes enemies to the mirror plane. To escape they must find and destroy it.
- Chance can be seen trapped in a giant hourglass on an infinite chequerboard.

River Chapman will trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane. Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the Six of Steel must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

> *Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

---

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

> *Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines.

Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

> The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
10. Caelum is captured by Talona, leaving Ten to activate the pillars and shield the relief.

The Annals of Tenebrae, held secretly within the [Oratory](locations#the-oratory)'s vaults, hold the words of [Tenebrae](lore#tenebrae) as they recount the alleged true events that led up to the [Rising](timeline#the-rising).

## **Ante Orientem**

### 10 AO

#### **Tenebrae's journey begins**

Once an earth genasi with another name, Tenebrae began their life as an artist. Receiving visions of a blight upon the land, Tenebrae felt compelled to paint a swirling dark purple void surrounding the region of [Profundus](locations#profundus). Having dwelt on the meaning of their ominous painting, Tenebrae was sought out by *Chauntea*, the deity of life and agriculture. She encouraged Tenebrae to travel the land and construct stone pillars that might retain the true history of events to come. These pillars would bear the blessings of Chauntea, *Lathander* and Bahamut so that together they might shield Profundus from the coming blight.

Tenebrae travelled the region for six years, beseeching those in power to prepare for the coming blight. Very few heeded their word. In that time, they and their followers managed to construct 24 pillars. However, upon hearing that many of the pillars had been vandalised by terror-stricken cynics, Tenebrae began to doubt their ability to complete the task entrusted to them. Fleeing from *Church of Lathander*, *Lao Tan*, until recently an aid to [Caelum Sol Orbis](lore#caelum-sol-orbis), sought out Tenebrae in order to tell the tale of the Grand Paladin's treachery. She implored Tenebrae to focus their efforts not on preparing for the inevitable, but on discovering a way to prevent it. She spoke of a cabal of powerful fiends that dwelt in the region of [Discidium](locations#discidium), who may be able to help.

### 4 AO

#### **Tenebrae creates a pact with the League of Archfiends**

Having challenged and rediscovered their resolve, Tenebrae travelled to the region of Discidium to seek out the *League of Archfiends*. Their number was said to include the powerful rakshasa sorcerer *Abhishek*, the alu-fiend seductress *Malaika*, the cambion warmonger *Arzhang*, and the durzagon artificer *Zdenek*. The fiends did not believe Tenebrae's tale until Malaika's agents returned with proof of Caelum's treachery. With the Archfiends' influence, Tenebrae's allies soon multiplied and collection began of the graphite required to construct the enormous diamond that would become the heart of [Mundi Eversor](lore#mundi-eversor); a great colossus that could match the powers of Caelum Sol Orbis, the aasimar who was to bring forth the [Miasma](lore#the-miasma) in his bid for ascension.

### 0 PO

#### **The Rising**

In a vast cavern deep beneath Discidium, Zdenek was able to refine the graphite into a diamond almost half a mile in diameter. With Eversor's heart complete, Abhishek began a ritual to graft half of Tenebrae's soul onto the diamond. Eversor's skeleton began to grow from the very earth surrounding them. The evacuation of Discidium drew the gaze of Caelum Sol Orbis. In his hubris, he called upon the *Saints* to prematurely begin the ritual to cleanse his mortal body of darkness so that he might ascend to divinity. Flying high above the Oratory, Caelum watched in horror as Mundi Eversor erupted from the ground beneath Discidium. Great chunks of earth crumbled away from Eversor's metallic form and rained down on what used to be Discidium. Leaving volcanic ash in its wake, Eversor began its approach to [Anfang](locations#caelums-landing).

As Eversor took enormous strides towards Anfang, Caelum sent his winged paladins to intercept the colossus. Arzhang took to the skies in defence of the colossus, cutting down many paladins with his flaming blade. Some paladins were able to climb Eversor and discover the diamond heart within, though their efforts to destroy it were in vain. Trapped above the Oratory by his own ritual, Caelum watched as Eversor began to stride across the [Altum Sea](locations#altum-sea), its mechanical legs great enough in size to reach the ocean's depths. Below, the Saints continued to chant, hoping that Caelum might gain the power to strike down Eversor before it arrived.

As Caelum summoned what power he had, a coruscation of light began to surround him. Seeing this, Tenebrae brought Eversor to a halt. Slowed by the ocean, there was no chance of reaching Anfang in time. Arzhang opened the chest of Eversor, revealing the diamond heart within. The heart began to hum and glow with radiant energy as Eversor charged its deadliest weapon. Sensing danger, Caelum tore himself from the ritual and darkness began to spill from his soul.

Wounded, Caelum spread his wings and launched himself towards Eversor. He appeared to those below as a divine spear, sheathed in radiant light yet leaving behind a wake of darkness. The spear pierced Eversor's heart, shattering it. Caelum fled back to Anfang only to discover the resulting shock wave had caused fissures to open up around his home. Caelum returned to the ritual, now spoiled by the Miasma leaking from his broken soul. As Eversor's body fell, [Fundus](lore#fundus) begin to rise. Yet Caelum was more concerned with his ascension. His loyal Saints would continue sapping the Miasma from his soul until the world beyond the pillars was shrouded in darkness. Once the turmoil had subsided, Caelum was nowhere to be found. The world had changed forever.
