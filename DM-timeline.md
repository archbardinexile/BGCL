The Annals of Tenebrae, held secretly within the [Oratory](locations#the-oratory)'s vaults, hold the words of [Tenebrae](lore#tenebrae) as they recount the alleged true events that led up to the [Rising](timeline#the-rising).

#### **Tenebrae's journey begins**

Once an earth genasi with another name, Tenebrae began their life as an artist. Receiving visions of a blight upon the land, Tenebrae felt compelled to paint a swirling dark purple void surrounding the region of [Profundus](locations#profundus). Having dwelt on the meaning of their ominous painting, Tenebrae was sought out by *Chauntea*, the deity of life and agriculture. She encouraged Tenebrae to travel the land and construct stone pillars that might retain the true history of events to come. These pillars would bear the blessings of Chauntea, *Lathander* and Bahamut so that together they might shield Profundus from the coming blight.

Tenebrae travelled the region for six years, beseeching those in power to prepare for the coming blight. Very few heeded their word. In that time, they and their followers managed to construct 24 pillars. However, upon hearing that many of the pillars had been vandalised by terror-stricken cynics, Tenebrae began to doubt their ability to complete the task entrusted to them. Fleeing from *Church of Lathander*, *Lao Tan*, until recently an aid to [Caelum Sol Orbis](lore#caelum-sol-orbis), sought out Tenebrae in order to tell the tale of the Grand Paladin's treachery. She implored Tenebrae to focus their efforts not on preparing for the inevitable, but on discovering a way to prevent it. She spoke of a cabal of powerful fiends that dwelt in the region of [Discidium](locations#discidium), who may be able to help.

#### **Tenebrae creates a pact with the League of Archfiends**

Having challenged and rediscovered their resolve, Tenebrae travelled to the region of Discidium to seek out the *League of Archfiends*. Their number was said to include the powerful rakshasa sorcerer *Abhishek*, the alu-fiend seductress *Malaika*, the cambion warmonger *Arzhang*, and the durzagon artificer *Zdenek*. The fiends did not believe Tenebrae's tale until Malaika's agents returned with proof of Caelum's treachery. With the Archfiends' influence, Tenebrae's allies soon multiplied and collection began of the graphite required to construct the enormous diamond that would become the heart of [Mundi Eversor](lore#mundi-eversor); a great colossus that could match the powers of Caelum Sol Orbis, the aasimar who was to bring forth the [Miasma](lore#the-miasma) in his bid for ascension.

#### **The Rising**

In a vast cavern deep beneath Discidium, Zdenek was able to refine the graphite into a diamond almost half a mile in diameter. With Eversor's heart complete, Abhishek began a ritual to graft half of Tenebrae's soul onto the diamond. Eversor's skeleton began to grown from the very earth surrounding them. The evacuation of Discidium drew the gaze of Caelum Sol Orbis. In his hubris, he called upon the *Saints* to prematurely begin the ritual to cleanse his mortal body of darkness so that he might ascend to divinity. Flying high above the Oratory, Caelum watched in horror as Mundi Eversor erupted from the ground beneath Discidium. Great chunks of earth crumbled away from Eversor's metallic form and rained down on what used to be Discidium. Leaving volcanic ash in its wake, Eversor began its approach to [Anfang](locations#caelums-landing).

As Eversor took enormous strides towards Anfang, Caelum sent his winged paladins to intercept the colossus. Arzhang took to the skies in defence of the colossus, cutting down many paladins with his flaming blade. Some paladins were able to climb Eversor and discover the diamond heart within, though their efforts to destroy it were in vain. Trapped above the Oratory by his own ritual, Caelum watched as Eversor began to stride across the [Altum Sea](locations#altum-sea), its mechanical legs great enough in size to reach the ocean's depths. Below, the Saints continued to chant, hoping that Caelum might gain the power to strike down Eversor before it arrived.

As Caelum summoned what power he had, a coruscation of light began to surround him. Seeing this, Tenebrae brought Eversor to a halt. Slowed by the ocean, there was no chance of reaching Anfang in time. Arzhang opened the chest of Eversor, revealing the diamond heart within. The heart began to hum and glow with radiant energy as Eversor charged its deadliest weapon. Sensing danger, Caelum tore himself from the ritual and darkness began to spill from his soul.

Wounded, Caelum spread his wings and launched himself towards Eversor. He appeared to those below as a divine spear, sheathed in radiant light yet leaving behind a wake of darkness. The spear pierced Eversor's heart, shattering it. Caelum fled back to Anfang only to discover the resulting shock wave had caused fissures to open up around his home. Caelum returned to the ritual, now spoiled by the Miasma leaking from his broken soul. As Eversor's body fell, [Fundus](lore#fundus) begin to rise. Yet Caelum was more concerned with his ascension. His loyal Saints would continue sapping the Miasma from his soul until the world beyond the pillars was shrouded in darkness. Once the turmoil had subsided, Caelum was nowhere to be found. The world had changed forever.
