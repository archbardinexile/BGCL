## **Session 33 (996, Inceptum 1st)**

### Into Darkness

- *Caelum* asked **Bantonio** to destroy the pillar.
- *Clara* told everyone about the expedition so the Inquisition can't hide it.
- *Bixi*, *Lorento*, *Kudi* and *Zaen* Madizos meet *Lenna* and **Firien** on Madanau.

#### **Encounters**

- The Verity must raise the canopies before acid rain begins. Some crew may be affected by psychosis.
- 8-10 ***harpies*** and 2 ***harpy matriarchs*** attempt to lure the crew of the Verity. Matriarchs may fight for dominance.
- Abandoned water filtration plant. Rotting bodies imply the settlers fled months ago when psychosis broke out. ***Arctic, coastal*** encounter tables.
- Enchanted ***forest***. Protective sigils scratched into trees. A wounded unicorn has had its horn cut off. Psychotic ***unicorns*** may attack.
- Settlement warding off the effects of psychosis with unicorn horns. ***Bandits*** may turn psychotic and attack. *Agrippina* is in jail for objecting to the use of unicorn horns. She must retrieve *Hans von Buch*.

#### **Find Glimback**

The expedition can be found in an abandoned inn, *The Vegetarian Virgin*. The inn is regularly attacked by ***aberrations***. Arti's heart protects them. Tiamo's gemstone turret alerts against intruders.

- *Glimback Toestubber*. Gnome artificer, head of the Commission.
- *Kalyptos*. Black dragonborn monster slayer ranger, Inquisitor.
- *Owain*. Harengon wild magic sorcerer, stuck in scared rabbit form.
- *Tiamo Trouve*. Human lapidurgy wizard. Exiled diamond guard and tactician.
- *Agrippina*. Gnome scribes wizard. Separated from expedition.

#### **Find the Pillar**

If the pillar is found, *Kalyptos* will attempt to dissuade the crew from touching it. If unsuccessful, he will reveal his Inquisition badge and summon:

- **Chimera**. **Scorpion tail.** Reach 5 ft. (10 ft. behind). DC 15 CON save. Paralysed on a failed save.

*Ten* can heal and/or restore players remotely through Arti. When coupled with Arti's heart, the magical fibres in Arti's chest will grow into muscles, granting him power. Arti may choose his appearance.

Whoever activates the pillar is granted a vision of a younger Ten painting a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander watch over them.

### Homecoming

The Inquisition will arrest the crew if they do not return immediately to the Oratory to debrief. Tristis may try to alter their memories in separate interviews.

*Tristis* successfully read **Blythe**'s thoughts leading to the arrest of *Camren*. The Inquisition ceased construction of *Loronath*'s submarine, leading *Vetra Bery* to steal the submarine plans and flee to the Manyshells. The Inquisition may try to retrieve the letter from the *Dawnroot Druids*.

*Subira* tracked the basilisk venom to an island in the Manyshells.

The petrified dinosaur rider from Primal Antiqua, *Miyoko*, has joined the Commission. She is from the year 744 PO. She helped settle the earthmote when it drifted toward her home. It provided a source of water until the basilisk came through, destroying the water portal.

### Find Naal Berevan

Naal was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Constable *Denover*'s proposal to send in his own undercover agent was refused so he couldn't interfere.

- *Vetra Bery* may kidnap Blythe and try to recruit her for the submarine crew. They intend to mutiny and use the submarine to search for and recover the body of Tenebrae (Arzhang).
  - If Blythe refuses, Naal will cast modify memory on Blythe. Leaving a message about his progress which must be delivered to the Grand Inquisitor.
- Vetra tells of the expedition from Tamlo in 972 PO that returned with an artefact. The Chruch intervened, murdering the expedition and sealing the artefact in the vault.
- Vetra knows about the expedition. She foretells of Blythe joining the Crosscut Circle once she discovers the truth in the Miasma.

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry cannot confirm the existence of the fallen miner as there is no paperwork. Therefore, the implementation of better health and safety in the mines is on hold. The union holds regular strikes led by *Harbek Goldmask*.

Spiro intends to encourage his sister to intervene and give the miners the safety they need. Aura will instruct the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlaw monopolies on essential goods.

The *Think Tank*, in league with the *Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory in order to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from *Micantrum* instead of the *Garnetgrinder Clan*. If proof is discovered the Church will demand they too sell their shares.

The *Think Tank* wish to know more about the expedition and have recruited **Blythe** via means of a puzzle. A business card leads Blythe to the drug dens of *Micantrum*.

### Anchorheart's Folly

*Lenna Madizos* was recently recalled from her work providing aid in the Manyshells and has been investigating why. Her only lead is the Church requisitioning vast amounts of Basilisk oil through independent guilds so it goes unnoticed. The basilisk oil is in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia, who have warriors that can petrify with their gaze.

**Guy**'s captain, *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing. Anchorheart has made a deal with Vasilissa. He offers resonance weapons and in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the Manyshells. *ABC* is headed to the Manyshells to investigate.

### Confront River Chapman

Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape. River Chapman may trap the party in his game room. They will face dice monsters on a chequerboard in the Plane of Mirrors.

Gomruss needs a key to the Plane of Mirrors. Research may uncover:
- An artefact buried in a tomb in Arx
- The Queen of Diamante's crown
- Bhaldrom's diamond eye

### The Diamond Ball

The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees. The crown jewels will be on display, ripe for theft.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition, led by *Xander Coppermane III*, became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.
