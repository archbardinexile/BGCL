## **Arcane Tradition**

### Lapidurgy

A lapidurge studies and shapes gemstones in great detail in order to achieve magical effects. By guiding the weave through a transparent gemstone, a lapidurge can refine and even augment their spells. The practice originated in Atada, where sparkling mineral deposits gave rise to the formidable *Diamond Guard*, who use staves of light to protect their queen.

#### **Stonecutter**

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with ***jeweller’s tools***. You cut, polish or engrave a set of 4 gemstones. Whenever you cast a spell that sheds light, a ***mote of light*** is captured in a gemstone of your choice. You can have a maximum of 4 motes of light at a time. You can expend a mote of light to activate one of the following effects:

**Chromatic Ray.** A beam of light streaks toward a creature within 60 feet. As an action, make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 damage. The gemstone you used determines the attack's damage type, as shown in the table below. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Prismatic Ward.** As an action, you create and don a luminous breastplate and shoulder protectors. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against the damage type of the gemstone you used.

**Gem Burst.** As an action, you create a momentary circle of luminous blades that sweep around you. All other creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 damage. The gemstone you used determines the attack's damage type. This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**Staff of Light.** As a bonus action, you imbue the quarterstaff you are holding with your gemstone's power. For 1 minute, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage type becomes that of the gemstone you used. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

#### **Refracting Light**

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you learn the ***dancing lights*** cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You can dismiss dancing lights as part of the action you used to cast it. When you do, you gain 4 ***motes*** of light.

#### **Modify Gem**

Starting at 6th level, you learn how to transmute gemstones into their mineral counterparts. You can transmute up to 3 gemstones when you finish a long rest, provided you have the material components. Diamond does not have a mineral counterpart and therefore cannot be transmuted.
