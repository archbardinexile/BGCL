## [**Barbarian Class Features**](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#barbarian_phb)

### Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the ***Player's Handbook*** when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a barbarian. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### **Primal Healing (Optional)**

Starting at 7th level, you can end your rage with a healing impulse as a bonus action. Up to six creatures of your choice that can hear you within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to 1d8 × your remaining rages. You can reduce the targets' psychosis level by 1, or end one of the following effects on each of the targets: blinded, deafened, paralysed, or poisoned.
