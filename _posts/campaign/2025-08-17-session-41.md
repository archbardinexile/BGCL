### Roundhouse

Inside the ramshackle abode, **Arti** is met by *Kalyptos*, the black dragonborn who encouraged *Glimback* to leave him behind. The monster slayer is holding a white rabbit. When Arti offers a home-grown tomato, the rabbit expresses his gratitude in a surprisingly deep, eloquent voice. *Owain*, a wild magic sorcerer, explains that he is stuck in his current form owing to a year's worth of stress. Arti finds Glimback curled up in the corner, cradling his heart. He approaches and rests a hand on his father's shoulder.

> "Arti will save us, yes... the voice said Arti is coming."
>
> *Glimback speaks to Arti's heart.*

Glimback caresses Arti's metallic cheek in disbelief before wrapping his arms around his son. Glimback listens intently as Arti recounts the events of the past month in record time. **Firien** and **Gomruss** detect a mote of concern on Kalyptos' reptilian brow when Arti mentions the Inquisition. After some subtle interrogation, they discover that Kalyptos worships Caelum. **Bantonio** strokes his chin. The dragonborn's Mallian accent suggests that Kalyptos was reformed by Church missionaries during the war. Kalyptos is adamant they forget about the pillar and proceed home immediately to minimise further exposure to the Miasma. Without warning, Arti embraces the dragonborn.

> "I know you don't have any family back home. But this family wants to help the people of the Relief. Maybe you could be a part of that?"
>
> *Arti hugs Kalyptos.*

### Moorland Village

The *Six of Steel* exit the roundhouse quietly, intent on sneaking past the frog army, only to find them lying in wait. A thousand vacant eyes train themselves on the bipeds soon to become their matriarch's next meal.
