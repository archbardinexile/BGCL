title: Session 53 Message in a Bottle
---

Feeling nostalgic, **Guy** studies the changes made to his old quarters on the *Marley*. Lying in his hammock, he thumbs the sigil on *Rose*'s sending stone once more. His ears prick up at a series of taps and scrapes on the recording. Rose had left a message in hoarse code! He and **Arti** work together to translate the code. It reads 'Follow fog. Find Daniel.'

> "..-. --- .-.. .-.. --- .-- / ..-. --- --. / ..-. .. -. -.. / -.. .- -. .. . .-.."
>
> *Follow fog. Find Daniel.*

Guy studies his map and finds *Daniel's Island* west of *Longrock*. He recalls how the island was abandoned after a series of destructive storms. *Daniel*, an eccentric meteorologist, repurposed the island's chapel for his research. With haste, Guy summons *Elyse* and the *Six of Steel*. Perhaps Daniel could tell them more about the fog.

## **996, Flavum 2nd**

The following morning presents clear skies. Course set for Daniel's Island, *Julian* adds the Six of Steel to the Marley's duty roster. While **Firien** concentrates on a gust of wind to accelerate the Marley, they spot Guy deliberately avoiding Elyse. On a break, they block Guy's path to address his misgivings. The lovesick captain doffs his hat in appreciation before joining the crew for a bowl of **Gomruss**' pressure-cooked fish stew.

### Daniel's Island

Approaching Daniel's Island, **Blythe** examines the chapel through her spyglass. A curious device has been mounted to its spire; three brass rings encircle a light source like a gyroscope. The tower mirrors a similar structure on the islet opposite. Curiously, a visible tidemark separates the upper third of Daniel's Island. While rotten wood and algae litters the shore, the garden around the chapel is immaculate.

The Six of Steel are greeted by *DAV3*, an automaton in Daniel's service, who shows them inside. Daniel emerges from behind a chalkboard, excited to meet the famous adventurers who dispersed the Miasma. When asked about the fog, he offers several explanations. *Anchorheart* could have enhanced his Tempest powers or used a magical artefact to create the fog, but it was more likely he had bound a water elemental to his ship.

To track such an elemental, Daniel would require several buoys to be placed around the bay. Sending stones attached to the buoys would record wind speed and water temperature which, when displayed as a projection, would show the elemental's path over time. Firien studies the eccentric human and judges him to be trustworthy if somewhat egotistical. However, Blythe remains suspicious when she spies the ring on Daniel's index finger.

Stamped into the gold face was the same eye sigil she found on the business card from *Ingenium*. **Bantonio**'s jaw hits the floor. He had seen the same sigil tattooed on *Loronath*'s chest! Daniel explains the symbol belongs to the *Society of Brilliance*, a think tank of reclusive but exceptional scholars, apparently fastidious in their recruitment policy. Daniel explains the card Blythe received must be a puzzle. If she could solve it, she may gain entry into the society. When Bantonio burned the card, it produced the smell of *joose*, which Gomruss unwittingly inhaled.
