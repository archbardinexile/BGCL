## **Bard College**

### College of Retainers

The College of Retainers

#### **Bonus Proficiencies**

When you join the College of Retainers at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with 1 weapon and: (a) 2 skills, (b) 2 tools, (c) 1 skill and 1 tool of your choice.

#### **Teaching Method**

Starting at 3rd level, you can choose a willing creature to become your ***ward***. You can only have 1 ward at a time and you must finish a long rest before you can choose a new ward. While your ward is within 60 feet of you, it gains benefits according to a ***teaching method*** of your choice. Changing your teaching method requires you to spend a short rest during which you might evaluate your ward's performance or establish a new curriculum.

- **Discipline.** When your ward rolls its Bardic Inspiration die, if the number rolled is a 1, it can re-roll the die and must use the new roll.
- **Motivation.** When your ward rolls its Bardic Inspiration die to add to an attack roll, if the number rolled is the highest possible, that attack becomes a critical hit.
- **Demonstration.** When your ward rolls its Bardic Inspiration die to add to an ability check, its proficiency bonus is doubled for that ability check provided you are also proficient in the required skill.
- **Reinforcement.** When your ward rolls its Bardic Inspiration die to add to a saving throw, it has advantage on that saving throw.

#### **Master of Etiquette**

At 6th level, if you are surprised at the start of an encounter, your ward gains a Bardic Inspiration die (if it does not already have one) and it rolls it immediately. Add the number rolled to the initiative of any number of creatures within 60 feet of you who can hear you.

#### **Legal Guardian**

At 14th level, while your ward is within 60 feet of you, it automatically gains a Bardic Inspiration die at the start of its turn if it does not already have one. You do not expend a use of Bardic Inspiration.
