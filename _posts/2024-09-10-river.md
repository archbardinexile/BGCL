title: How to Play River
---

Of all the games one might frequent in a local tavern, River serves as a common way to earn free drinks or lose a small fortune. It is played in much the same way as *Poker* only with dice instead of cards.

### Rules

1. A round begins with each player purchasing five dice from the *banker*: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10 and 1d12. These become the players' *hole dice*. The banker decides the price of the dice but the price must be the same for each player. This serves as the starting bet or *ante*. The gold is added to the *pot*.
2. Each player rolls their hole dice and keeps them hidden.
3. The banker rolls 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10 and 1d12 and reveals them for *auction*.
4. Players may bid for the auctioned dice. The player who places the highest bid for an individual die may add it to their *hand*. A player's hand can only be made of 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10 and 1d12. For example, if 1d4 is won at auction, it cannot be used together with that player's hole d4. All gold spent at auction is added to the pot.
5. Once the auction is complete, the players reveal their hands. The player with the highest value hand wins the round and takes the pot.

**Tip**: A player may choose to bid at auction in order to make another player spend more gold, or to prevent them from adding a die to their hand.
