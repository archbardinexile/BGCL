## **Manyshells**

### Anchorheart's Folly

> *Lenna Madizos* discovered the Church was requisitioning basilisk venom in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia. *Subira* tracked the venom to Rose Merryn’s Pre-Loved Goods in *Runnelstone*.

> *Elyse* asked *Rose* to smuggle basilisk venom as part of her investigation. Rose and Subira were captured by *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* when his fleet attacked Runnelstone. Rose's shop and the venom were destroyed.

> The venom was purchased by *Jeremias Blackflight* and hidden from the exarchy. The Six of Steel tricked his insurance broker, *Bertrand Magnier*, to make a donation to the Church, securing his support.

Anchorheart has bound a powerful water elemental to his ship, the *Umberlee's Wrath*. It can shroud his fleet in fog. The Six of Steel have enlisted the help of *Daniel*, a meteorologist and member of the *Society of Brilliance*. Using sending buoys, *DAV3* can track the elemental's movements inside *Killigrew Mor*.

Anchorheart ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. He offers the Queen gemlock weapons and in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the *Manyshells*. The destruction of the venom was ordered by Queen *Vasilissa*, in league with Anchorheart. The queen gave him an artefact to help him bind the elemental.

### Before the Storm

*ABC* will use *Rose*'s sending stone to warn the Six of Steel that the Umberlee's Wrath is three days from *Farwest*. The Six of Steel must proceed at full speed to *Farwest* to arrive in time. The *Lady Firehair* is built for speed and has no weapons.

If warned via sending, *Vetra* will take the submarine to *Os Terrae*. A warning via dead drop will not arrive in time. ***Thugs*** may attack the Six of Steel if they return to the dead drop or investigate *Thibault*'s ship, the *Arxman*. Thibault can give the exact location of the Crosscut Circle base, *Pedn Vounder*.

### The Siege of Farwest

The *Crosscut Circle* have allied with the githzechi to construct the submarine. Anchorheart will intercept the githzechi ships on ***Flavum 8th*** and attempt to follow them to the *Farwest* archipelago. The Umberlee's Wrath will arrive on ***Flavum 11th*** and attack.

- Anchorheart must succeed on a ***stealth check*** to follow the githzechi ships
  - ***If attacked***, the githzechi ships will not lead Anchorheart to *Farwest* unless charmed (12th)
  - ***If followed***, Anchorheart will bombard Farwest and attempt to take the Crosscut Circle base (11th)
    - Undamaged Githzechi ships may join the battle against Anchorheart

- If the *Crosscut Circle* are warned, the unfinished submarine will leave for *Os Terrae*
- *ABC* is aboard the Umberlee's Wrath posing as a powder monkey. She can sabotage its weapons.
- Elyse will successfully garner *Free Trade Navy* support
  - Ships won't arrive until ***Flavum 14th***
  - Airships won't arrive until ***Flavum 12th***

The Umberlee's Wrath's crew is composed of **Pirates*** with hit points 44–68.

### Project Abyss

> *Naal* was picked by *Tristis* to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his relationship with *Camren de Villeneuve*. Camren has been arrested. Naal and *Vetra Bery* now assemble the stolen submarine in the *Farwest* archipelago with help from *githzechi* engineers.

Vetra wants to recover the body of Tenebrae (*Arzhang*) from *Mundi Eversor* in the *Vena Trench*. She intends to revive him and prove that Caelum created the Miasma. The Six of Steel cannot reveal that the body inside Mundi Eversor is not Tenebrae, lest they break their oath.

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

> Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

Lighting the candles creates a portal to a corridor of mirrors presenting infinite destinations. The Six of Steel may have to fight their duplicates to continue.

- The Arx expedition can be seen trapped in a sandstone maze demiplane.
  - Six of Steel must guide them out while battling mirror mephits.
  - Darkhalijz, the spirit cloak worn by Xander Coppermane, tells how the staff from his collection banishes enemies to the mirror plane. To escape they must find and destroy it.
- Chance can be seen trapped in a giant hourglass on an infinite chequerboard.

River Chapman will trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane. Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the Six of Steel must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

> *Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

> *Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines.

Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

> The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
10. Caelum is captured by Talona, leaving Ten to activate the pillars and shield the relief.
