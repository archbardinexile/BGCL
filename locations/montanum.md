title: Montanum
---

Montanum, to the west, is characterised by its expansive mountain ranges. Though much of the region is obscured by the Miasma, the peninsula of [Porta Ignota](#porta-ignota) serves as an invaluable trade hub for intrepid explorers of the magical purple fog.

### Madanau

Madanau has been revealed by scholars to be one of the first earthmotes to arrive in Fio during [Caelum's Light](../lore#caelums-light). Estimated to be nearly 800 years old, this desert earthmote lies far erde-west of Caelum's Landing, treacherously close to the Miasma. Madanau has made its name as a valued hub of trade, able to grow and export exotic fruits and spices that cannot be found anywhere else in the Relief. The grand, circular oasis at Madanau's centre hosts a portal to the elemental plane of water, providing an abundance of fresh water and delicious fish. However, in [996 PO](../timeline#996-po) the portal was damaged by a falling shard from a rogue earthmote. Under the administration of [Sana Sol Orbis](../characters#sana-sol-orbis) the citizens of the ancient desert earthmote were able to stabilise the portal.

### Creed's Hollow

Stabilised skew-east of Madanau, Creed's Hollow emerged from the Miasma in a ring of hellfire in 996 PO. The earthmote flew over Madanau and rained imps from the *Nine Hells* down upon its citizens. Though Madanau was able to repel the attack, the oasis at its centre was damaged by a shard of hellish black rock that fell from the rogue earthmote. With the imps defeated, monks of the Spirit Temple were able to arrest the earthmote and greet its denizens. The Church's ambassadors were met by a village of tiefling farmers who, until recently, had been living in seclusion in Avernus, free of *Zariel*'s rule. Creed's Hollow enjoys healthy relations with the Church, and trades in agricultural produce native to the Nine Hells.

### Porta Ignota

### Vena trench

The largest congregation of sea-folk in the Relief resides at the bottom of the Vena Trench. This mysterious underwater city has been named [Abyssus](#abyssus) by explorers that have until recently only inferred its existence. Not much is known about the city, other than it lies east of Mundi Eversor.

#### **Abyssus**

Expeditions to this underwater city have been met with adversity, trying to combat the pressure of the trench's depths and indeed its protective citizens. In [990 PO](../timeline#990-po), an advanced submarine made by Ingenium's top artificers succeeded in capturing an image of the city from above, revealing curious illuminated domed structures like the tops of jellyfish. The submarine was subsequently attacked on its return journey by merfolk riding giant sharks. Fortunately, the crew was able to escape unharmed.
