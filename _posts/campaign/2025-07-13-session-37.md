title: Session 37 The Shielded Forest
---

Below deck, the crew lick their wounds. **Firien** visits **Bantonio** in his quarters and offers him a sandwich. The hopeless romantic had fallen from his bunk when the *Verity* pitched up suddenly. Though well rested, Bantonio admits that his faith has been shaken. Firien consoles Bantonio by sharing what their faith means to them. Though angered by hindsight in light of recent revelations, Bantonio succeeds in cheering his friend up.

> "If Caelum's plan is ineffable... I can't just... eff it, you know?"
>
> "I think you could eff it."
>
> "Perhaps, if I put in the eff-ort!"
>
> *Bantonio to Firien.*

Before the night crew take their stations, **Guy** and **Arti** check the Verity's course. They should arrive at the *Shielded Forest* tomorrow morning. As Arti concentrates, an absent sound suddenly returns to him. He could hear his heart beating! They were on the right track. Meanwhile, **Gomruss** attempts to contact *Roshia* and inform her about his discovery. Despite concentrating intensely, he receives no reply from his mentor. The mirror in his quarters remains unoccupied. It seemed even divine emissaries could not defy the stifling Miasma.

On deck, Firien approaches Spiro with a private question. However, sensing the Grand Paladin's unrest, they decide not to voice their concerns. Instead, Firien confides in Spiro, questioning *Bahamut*'s choice of champion. To the dragonborn's surprise, Spiro grips their shoulder and expresses his faith in them. With renewed confidence, Firien retires to their quarters to read a romantic novel.

> "I've been so fucking angry all day. I can feel it stoking the lightning under my skin. Someone with such destructive power should be measured; composed. I don't know if I'm capable of dispensing Bahamut's mercy as well as his justice."
>
> "Firien, Bahamut chose you for a reason. I have no doubt you are capable of mercy and wrath in equal quantity. When the time comes, you'll know which is which."
>
> *Firien to Spiro.*
