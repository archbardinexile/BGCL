### Bandorul's Winning Streak

*3rd-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shamrock leaf, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature that you can see within range. For the duration, when that creature makes a successful attack roll, it can roll ***lucky dice*** in place of the normal damage dice of its weapon or spell. Lucky dice are never rolled in place of damage dice from an item's magical properties (e.g. from attunement, charges etc.).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bonus increases according to the lucky dice table. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bonus increases according to the lucky dice table.

##### **Lucky Dice**

| Normal damage die | Lucky die  | 5th level  | 7th level  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ?d4               | ?d6        | ?d8        | ?d10       |
| ?d6               | ?d8        | ?d10       | ?d12       |
| ?d8               | ?d10       | ?d12       | ?d12 + ?d4 |
| ?d10              | ?d12       | ?d12 + ?d4 | ?d12 + ?d6 |
| ?d12              | ?d12 + ?d4 | ?d12 + ?d6 | ?d12 + ?d8 |

### Double or Nothing

*1st-level divination*

- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take after making an attack roll
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Whenever you make an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll an additional d20. You can cast this spell after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll. If the attack hits, it becomes a critical hit. If the attack misses, you have disadvantage on your next attack roll. You cannot cast this spell in reaction to an attack roll that already has advantage or disadvantage.

### Joy's Mailed Mockery

*Enchantment cantrip*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Components:** S, M (a sheet of parchment, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You scribble a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments onto a sheet of parchment. The parchment folds itself into a paper plane and flies toward the target. If the target opens the parchment, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

There is a chance the parchment will be damaged when travelling distances over 120 feet. The DM may ask for an ability check to determine whether or not the spell reaches its target.

### Imprison Creature

*4th-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flask, locket or playing card)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and a sustained arc of magical energy connects the target to the flask (or similar item) in your hand. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points before the spell ends, it shrinks to an imperceptible height and is imprisoned inside the flask. While inside the flask, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.

The flask becomes a magical item with 10 charges: while holding it, you can use an action to call forth the creature you imprisoned. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature disappears back into the flask when it drops to 0 hit points or when you use an action to end the spell. The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you expend the flask's last charge, or the flask is destroyed, the creature is released and flees. The creature can attempt to break free of the flask at the end of every day provided that it has an Intelligence score higher than 2. It must succeed on a DC 20 Strength check or remain imprisoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 and the DC increases by 2 for each slot level above 4th.

### Lantern Flail

*Martial weapon, melee weapon, very rare (requires attunement).* 2 lb.

**1d8 bludgeoning.**

You gain a ***+1 bonus*** to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a hit, the target takes an extra ***1d4 radiant damage***. This weapon sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. It also disperses fog in a 20-foot radius. The fog reforms behind you as you move through it.

### Stonelock Pistol

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon, firearm, rare.* 500 gp, 3 lb.

**2d6 piercing. Ammunition (50/150 ft.), loading.**

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Stonelock Musket

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon, firearm, rare.* 1000 gp, 10 lb.

**2d8 piercing. Ammunition (80/240 ft.), loading, two-handed.**

**Two-handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

### Zip-Wheel

*Improvised weapon, ranged weapon, firearm.* 200 gp, 3 lb.

**3d4 bludgeoning. Ammunition (15 ft. cone), loading, two-handed.**

You drop a handful of ball bearings into your zip-wheel while it spins at high speed. On an attack roll of 5 or less: the zip-wheel jams and must be repaired using an action.
