title: Session 29 Dragons and Dreams
---

**Arti**, **Bantonio**, **Firien** and **Blythe** return to *Crowswood Place* and are elated by the smell of *Subira*'s cooking. While helping in the kitchen, Bantonio learns that Subira used to be an elite and indiscriminate assassin. The elderly tabaxi twitches when Bantonio asks after her loved ones. She simply claims to be too old now for romance. *Adelaide* examines Arti's supply list and offers ***2000 gold*** toward the total cost. Overhearing Firien's plans to drop *Lenna* off at *Madanau* prompts **Gomruss** to call his parents. Panicked by their son's apparent hubris, *Jaagins* and *Roolu Bandorul* leap into their car, intent on dragging Gomruss home.

Jaagins bangs on the door and is greeted by a resolute Firien. Despite the demands of the dragonborn, Firien blocks their entrance until Gomruss has finished his meal. Gomruss recites his explanation in detail, trying to summon the confidence to face his overprotective parents. Though his father flippantly dismisses his persuasion attempts, pride swells in Gomruss' stomach when every member of the *Six of Steel* stands to support him.

> "I didn't want to say this, Gomruss. But your graviturgical skills are mediocre at best! Do you really think you have anything to offer this foolhardy expedition?"
>
> "He's not a graviturgist, he's a very naughty boy!"
>
> *Jaagins and Roolu discourage Gomruss.*

Listening to the testimony of Gomruss' peers gives Jaagins pause. Roolu's eyes glisten at her son's declaration of faith. She whispers in Jaagins ear, perhaps realising the role *Bahamut* had to play in her son's destiny. When Jaagins offers assistance, Firien instead solicits an apology on Gomruss' behalf. Smoke billows from Jaagins' lips as he reluctantly admits his controlling nature. He embraces his son before departing alongside Roolu.

Before retiring, Bantonio approaches *Droleg*, who is casually strumming his lute. Fascinated, Bantonio asks if the hobgoblin might teach him *Saint Lydia's song*. **Guy**'s dictation is promptly interrupted by the sound of Bantonio's clumsy plucking. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he begins again. The intern types three letters for Guy, one of which is addressed to his wife.

> Elyse.

> Much left unsaid. For my part, I apologise. For yours, I understand. Due to embark upon a journey from which I may not return. My mind eternally gravitates towards you.
>
> Be well.

> *Guy Brush.*
