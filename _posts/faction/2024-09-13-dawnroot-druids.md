title: Dawnroot Druids
---

The Dawnroot Druids make their home in the *Dawnroot Forest* on [Fundus](profundus#fundus), secluded from the trappings of lifestyle in the capital. They revere and protect a portal to the elemental plane of water, the source of the *River Fountainhead*, which they believe to be a blessing from *Silvanus*, the deity of wild nature. Though they disapprove of the [Church](church-of-caelum)'s expansionist practices, they seem to prefer not to intervene.
