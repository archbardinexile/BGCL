title: Session 27 Did You Order an Earthmote?
---

*Loronath* thanks the *Six of Steel* for their help and offers **Guy** his sending sigil so they might further discuss plans for the submarine. Guy bids a fond farewell to *Agnes* who intends to continue her investigation in the Manyshells. The pair share a hug. **Arti** takes notes on how to build a successful parental relationship. With guards still on the lookout for Guy, he suggests they take a private overnight cable car to *Caelum's Landing*. While they wait, Arti wishes to visit a bookshop.

### Firerocks Tower

A central spiral staircase leads to thirty storeys of books in the palatial *Firerocks Tower*. **Gomruss**' eyes glow with excitement as he types a query into a nearby terminal. Several books on graviturgy are highlighted by dancing lights and he rushes off to examine them. **Bantonio** works with Arti to research *Saint Lydia*. After entering a query, a mechanical crane delivers a novel dramatising the life of Saint Lydia Iremia. Bantonio settles down to read. Arti struggles to find any reference to his dream visitor. However, he does find a songbook with the complete lyrics to Saint Lydia's song. Arti decides to extend his research to Blood Hunter rituals and finds a curious example of how an earth genasi changed colour after taking the Ghostslayer's ritual.

**Firien**'s talons wander the shelves in search of survival techniques. Though there are no books detailing what they might encounter in the Miasma, Firien feels they can apply what they find in a popular adventurer's survival guide. Guy decides to brush up on his sailing techniques in preparation for the expedition. Troubled by the abundance of dwarf villains they've encountered, Blythe decides to purchase two books on the Dwarvish language. She passes a weeping Bantonio on her way to the counter. Apparently he found Lydia's story extremely moving.

Gomruss eyes grow wide when he discovers a curious reference in book about graviturgical artefacts. An ancient thief king of Arx once collected powerful magical staves including a staff that could move heavy objects and a rod that could temporarily imprison a creature within the Plane of Mirrors.
