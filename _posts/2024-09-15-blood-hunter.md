## Blood Hunter Order

At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunters whose philosophy will guide you throughout your life. The following options are available to you when making that choice: Order of the Lantern.

### Order of the Lantern

The Order of the Lantern is a clandestine clique of Blood Hunters who perform blood rituals in order to safely traverse the Miasma.

### Rite of the Dusk

When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dusk as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of the Dusk, the extra damage dealt by your rite is acid damage. Additionally, while that rite is active on your weapon, you gain the following benefits:
- Your weapon ignores resistance to acid damage.
- Your weapon disperses fog out to a radius of 20 feet. The fog reforms behind you as you move through it.

### Caustic Blood

Starting at 3rd level, whenever you roll your hemocraft die to activate a rite or amplify a blood curse, the damage you take becomes acid. The minimum damage you can take using this feature becomes 1.

### Stoichiometry

Starting at 7th level, you have resistance to acid damage. The first time you take acid damage on a turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the end of your next turn.

### Blood Curse of the Miasma

Upon reaching 18th level, you gain the Blood Curse of the Miasma for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your number of blood curses known.

**Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lantern.**
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of caustic, dark purple fog centred on a point you choose within 120 feet. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for 10 minutes or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the curse's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

**Amplify.**
On each of your turns after you use this curse, you can use a bonus action to move the fog up to 60 feet in any direction. When a creature ends its turn in the fog, it becomes vulnerable to acid damage for the duration of the curse.
