## **996, Roscidas 19th**

### Tenebrae's Refuge

Eager to get underway, the *Six of Steel* wake up early to catch the cable car back to Tenebrae's Refuge. They find *Cade* in the *Bogus Broadsword* having returned late from a contemplative walk beneath the stars. **Bantonio** is quick to offer the dwarf a coffee to replace the half-drunk ale in his hand. While the others take breakfast, **Gomruss** marches up to *Tabitha*'s room and finds his sweetheart fast asleep. He knocks on the door to wake her and the pair spend the early hours enthusing about Gomruss' new spell. The dragonborn confides that today he has debts to settle on Caelum's Landing. Shocked, Tabitha suggests Gomruss take legal action against the debt collectors.

Bantonio offers a coffee to the local bard who appears exhausted. In return, the bard dedicates a song to Bantonio. **Arti** immediately recognises the song as the one from their dream. The warforged eavesdrops on Bantonio's conversation with the bard. According to him, the song is *Saint Lydia's Song*, one of the first songs he ever learned. **Firien** recounts their knowledge of *Saint Lydia* to Arti: she was an earth genasi who lived in the third century in the waning days of *Cor Sol Orbis*' exarchy. Travelling from the distant lands of *Montanum*, Lydia offered her services as nurse to the ailing Exarch and promptly fell in love with him. She would not become recognised as a saint until after the exarchy of *Rex Sol Orbis*, conqueror of *Atada* and *Atado*. Bantonio's mind is blown once again when his friends describe the founder of his home not as a unifier but as a tyrant.

### Sundered Peaks

After arriving at *Fundus Park*, the party decide to take a taxi as far as *Caelum's Landing* and walk to the *Spirit Temple*. The clement weather proves invigorating as they hike around the foot of the *Sundered Peaks*. They pass a citadel carved into the stone of the mountains. Gomruss identifies it as the *Ruins of Caer Wraidd*, the ancient residence of *Anfarwol*, the immortal elf-king of *Anfang*, now known as Caelum's Landing. Gomruss recounts how Anfarwol was slain by Caelumites in the sacking of Caer Wraidd, not long after the *Rising*.

### Spirit Temple

Ascending a weaving dirt path to the top of a hill, the Spirit Temple comes into view. Outside, the party witnesses the monks using their spiritual connection with nature to till the soil and help their crops grow. Inside, they are greeted by *Blue-Belly*, a chameleon-like lizardfolk with one large horn and a blue belly. The wide-eyed monk guides them to Master *Baihu*'s study, whereupon Arti delivers their proposal. Though appreciative of Arti's resolve to rescue *Glimback*, Baihu expresses concern for the wellbeing of the five monk volunteers required for the mission. Arti explains how they intend to set up lanterns around the earthmote to shield it from the *Miasma*.

Arti confides that they failed on the expedition into the Miasma one year ago, and their heart was lost. Sensing the warforged's confusion, Baihu suggests Arti might partake in a guided meditation to revisit their lost memories. Arti clutches Firien's hand as they are led to *Keijo*, a young half-elf monk with the countenance of a tiger. Keijo shares a hug with Firien, having acquainted himself with the dragonborn six months ago when *Madanau* was threatened by a rogue earthmote and Firien was blessed by *Bahamut* to combat a horde of fiends. Arti sits opposite Keijo and takes his hands. Arti's hands tremble as they are suddenly pulled into a dream state.

### The Miasma
