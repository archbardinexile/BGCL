##### **Fundus Park to Caelum's Landing**

Fundus Park is a small town on the south-western shore of Fundus. It has several amenities one might need after a lengthy journey. A tavern, several inns, even a tourist information centre. The park itself has rolling green hills and a lush pond with a statuesque fountain in the centre.

The ruckus of the town is replaced with the chirps of grasshoppers when the party departs. The road to Caelum's Landing is bracketed by patchwork fields of yellow rapeseed, maize, wheat and other cereals dotted with the windmill homes of farmers.

- Players can choose to walk to Caelum's Landing or get a taxi: taxi holds 4, 6 silver per taxi.
- Taxi may break down requiring the party to help repair

Players enter the *Wind District* where shoppers and tourists can find the heart of the Relief's commerce. Players can find stalls of travelling merchants, workshops of craftsmen from all over the Relief, and skilled alchemists who can both heal and invigorate the most daring of adventurers. Today is the Guilds Exhibition where guilds from all over the Relief can sell goods and recruit members.

**Attending guilds:**

- **Church of Caelum.** Recruiting acolytes, accepting charity
- **The Commission.** Recruiting explorers
- **The Diamond Guard** Recruiting squires
- **The Ministry.** Offering careers advice
- **Inland guard.** Recruiting constables
- **Miner's Union.** Raising awareness of terrible conditions in Resonant Mines
- **Bounty Hunters Codex.** Local lodge offering jobs: retrieve, deliver, exterminate, eliminate
- **Merchants Guild.** Selling goods, Majdi may be present in his air-caravan

- **Ingenium Inventors Association.** Exhibiting new inventions: camera, automatic cooking implements

**Firien** is heading to the Church stall to deliver cookies and relieve their half-orc friend, **Grevik**. Another acolyte may take Firien's place if required.
**Arti** will recognise the *Commission*. The explorer at the stall can direct them to Crowswood Place.
**Guy** might ask a local smith where they can find a stonelock pistol. These are rare, manufactured primarily in *Ingenium* and used by high ranking members of the *Inland Guard*.
**Gomruss** may encounter disgruntled gamblers or debt collectors looking to take back the money owed to them.

**Blythe** could ask about *Naal Berevan* at the Church stall. Grevik believes Naal joined the Inquisition. He hasn't seen Naal since. Firien might know this.
**Bantonio** might try to avoid going to Caelum's Landing University as Isabela, his sister, is a Professor of Philosophy there.

##### **Gomruss Gets Attacked**

- 2-4 drunken ***Thugs*** attack Gomruss when they recognise him. Gomruss owes the leader 50 gold.
- Thugs use ***Pack tactics.*** Unarmed strikes only unless the party retaliates with a weapon or magic.

##### **Fight at Pirate Drop-Off**

*Michael Denover* may track down the party hoping to retrieve his badge, stolen by Blythe. Rather than press charges, he asks for help in taking the remaining pirates into custody. Their drop-off point was an earthmote below the Calligo Way, now drifting north.

- 2d12 location
- 5-7 **Bandits** with *zip-wheels (3d4 bludgeoning. Ammunition (15 ft. cone), loading, two-handed.)*

- Pirates will try to load the cargo onto their airship and flee

##### **Bounty: Creatures at the Lighthouse**

- 5-7 **Pteranodon CR 1** aberrations with 6 levels of psychosis: disadvantage on attacks and saves, speed and hit points **10-14** (halved), must attack nearest creature.
- Creature's attacks require constitution saving throw DC 13 to avoid gaining a level of psychosis.
