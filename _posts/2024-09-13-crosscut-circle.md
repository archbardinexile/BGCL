---

The Crosscut Circle work in the shadows to expose the hypocrisy of the [Church of Caelum](church-of-caelum). They claim the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma) was released 1,000 years ago as a result of [Caelum](getting-started#caelum-sol-orbis)'s ritual to expel the darkness within him so that he might to ascend to divinity. They also claim [Mundi Eversor](getting-started#mundi-eversor) was created by [Tenebrae](getting-started#tenebrae) and his followers in order to stop Caelum.
