Before **Guy** can explain himself, *Agnes Briar-Colton* lifts the kitchen rug and throws Guy down the cellar hatch. A guard knocks on the door. Heavy boots rattle the hatch as the guard enters to question Agnes. After a few tense moments, Guy hears the guard exit and Agnes opens the hatch. The pair bicker in whispers before finally deciding to trust one another.

Guy reveals the trouble he's in. Having consorted with a pirate crew in the Manyshells, captain *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* tasked him with retrieving the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle. Agnes pinches the bridge of her nose. This did not bode well. Agnes reveals she came to Ingenium to investigate the CSCA's funding of *Project Abyss*, the construction of a deep-sea submarine. According to her, the CSCA have increased fees in order to expand their fleet in the Manyshells. If the pirate factions are looking to develop underwater weapons, war may be inevitable.

The pair now consider their escape plan. First, Guy borrows some casual clothes from Agnes' wardrobe and stuffs his own clothes into the bag of holding. Realising his bag may be searched, Guy borrows Agnes' sewing kit to create a false compartment that hides the real one. When questioned, Guy reveals that his plan is to rendezvous with the *Six of Steel* at the *House of Sune*.
