## **Weapons**

### Compound Bow

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon.* 60 gp, 4 lb.

**1d8 piercing. Ammunition (150/600 ft.), heavy, two‑handed.**

This weapon's levering system doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls when attacking at long range.

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Two-handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

### Crow's Lantern Flail

*Martial weapon, melee weapon, very rare (requires attunement).* 2 lb.

**1d8 bludgeoning. Reach, special.**

This magic weapon grants a ***+1 bonus*** to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action. It also disperses fog in a 30-foot radius. The fog reforms behind the wielder as they move through it.

The weapon has 4 charges. The wielder can expend 1 charge deal an extra ***1d8 radiant damage***. The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.

**Special.** You can attempt to grapple a creature as part of your attack with this weapon (you do not need a free hand).

### Gomruss' Staff

*Simple weapon, melee weapon, spellcasting focus (requires attunement).*

**1d6 bludgeoning. Versatile (1d8).**

An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

While holding this item, a creature gains a ***+1 bonus*** to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack. The bonus increases to ***+2*** when you reach 10th level in this class.

While holding this item, you can use it to cast the ***Bandorul’s Surface Shift*** spell as an action. This property of the staff can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Grappling Whip

*Martial weapon, melee weapon.* 6 gp, 3 lb.

**1d4 slashing. Finesse, reach, special.**

You can use this weapon to climb up to 10 feet or swing up to 15 feet by grappling an adequate support above you.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Special.** You can attempt to grapple a creature as part of your attack with this weapon (you do not need a free hand).

### Poison Blade of the Ambitious Assassin

*Simple weapon, melee weapon, rare (requires attunement).* 1 lb.

**1d4 piercing + 1d10 poison. Finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.).**

This weapon returns to the wielder's hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

## **Firearms**

### Gemlock Musket

*Martial weapon, ranged weapon, firearm, rare.* 1000 gp, 10 lb.

**1d12 piercing. Ammunition (40/120 ft.), loading, two-handed, special.**

This weapon has an additional trigger that fires all 3 barrels at once. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 piercing damage for each loaded barrel. The weapon must then be reloaded.

**Reload.** A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

**Special.** This weapon does not use gunpowder, its ammunition is magically propelled, making it almost silent. You do not give away your location when you make an attack with this weapon. This weapon can be used in environments where a traditional firearm would not function (e.g. underwater).
