## [**Barbarian Class Features**](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#barbarian_phb)

### Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the ***Player's Handbook*** when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a barbarian. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### **Primal Healing (Optional)**

Starting at 7th level, you can unleash your rage in a wave of healing energy. Up to six creatures of your choice within 30 feet each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your Strength modifier. Also, you can reduce each target's psychosis level by 1, or end 1 condition afflicting each target. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralysed, or poisoned.

Your rage ends early if you use this feature while raging. Once you have used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. The healing increases by 1d8 when you reach 11th level (3d8), 15th level (4d8), and 19th level (5d8).
