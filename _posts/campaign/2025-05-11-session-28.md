title: Session 28 Skyfaring for Beginners

**Arti** hears the commotion outside. Before attending **Guy**'s impromptu lecture on sailing, Arti confesses to *Hadley* and *Adelaide* that he knows about Arthur. Hadley launches herself at Arti, pulling him and Adelaide into a group hug. Adelaide wipes away a tear when Arti lists the childhood activities he wants to catch up on. After gathering some personal effects from *Glimback*'s room, the trio head outside to help prepare the earthmote.

**Blythe** meets **Bantonio** and **Gomruss** in the hall. Curious about the card Blythe holds, Bantonio catches the scent of vinegar. Having written many secret messages to his paramour, he suggests warming the card with a candle. Sure enough, a Dwarvish cipher is revealed on the back of the card. Blythe sets to work; perhaps 'Find us' had a secret meaning. To her dismay, the deciphered words are gibberish, until Gomruss reads them aloud. The language was Primordial! It reads 'Burn it'. Bantonio brings the candle to the card. The card burns with a purple flame, releasing a plume of sparkling smoke. Gomruss inhales the smoke and a wave of euphoria briefly overwhelms him.

Staggering outside, Gomruss employs **Firien** to check his health. Firien finds the clamorous wizard's eyes have dilated, and a familiar but unpleasant scent lingers on his clothes. Having helped rehabilitate several addicts as part of their Church duties, Firien recognises the symptoms associated with *joose*, a recreational drug famously legal in *Micantrum*. Blythe pinches her chin. She was inclined to dismiss this as a dealer's free sample. But why would a dealer create a cipher? If it was meant for her, why place it in a Dwarvish language book? It seemed the answers were on Micantrum.

*Tuperk* defers to Guy's expertise and assembles his engineers to install the sails on the earthmote. The Crows heave the mast upright with a little help from Gomruss' graviturgy. Guy marvels as the mainsail is hoisted aloft. It billows majestically in the wind. The earthmote was starting to look like a ship! Sensing the Crows are frustrated with Guy's leadership, *Doom* squeezes the pirate's shoulder. The Crows give a cheer when they hear Guy's catchphrase! Meanwhile, Arti and Firien prepare a list of supplies they will need for the expedition.

> "You know, give them a little encouragement. And maybe tone down the dorky shit a little."

### Sun District

Arti, Bantonio, Firien and Blythe pair off to shop for supplies in the *Sun District*. Estimating a journey no longer than a month, they must prepare food and accommodation for a crew of 25 in addition to Glimback and the six expedition survivors. With some expert haggling, the four secure substantial discounts on some wholesale items. The total comes to ***3976 gold***. Arti examines the list. Hadley could brew the potions of cure psychosis they needed, and Tuperk had some surplus pteranodon leather for repairs. All that remained was to wait for *Roshia* to deliver the Arxian glass lanterns.

### Bounty Hunters Lodge

In passing the *Bounty Hunters Lodge*, Firien is reminded of someone who might provide answers to the mining dispute. The dragonborn greets *Gerti Garnetgrinder* in the foyer and she agrees to speak with Firien in private. Immediately, she claims to have renounced her family business. Originally from *Xor*, her parents' exploitative Underdark work ethic had gained them considerable wealth in *Ruby*.
