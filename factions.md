Ruled by the *Exarch*, [Aura Sol Orbis](characters#aura-sol-orbis), the territories of this *constitutional theocracy* reach as far as the [Miasma](lore#the-miasma). The nation's capital, [Caelum's Landing](locations#caelums-landing), is amongst the largest and most populous cities in the Relief, with much of the region's trade passing through its markets.

Since the creation of the *Fundus Constitution* in [416 PO](timeline#416-po), the Chairman of the [Ministry](#the-ministry) must present new laws to the Exarch for sanction. The Church has remained the most influential and widespread religion in [Fio](lore#fio) for 1,000 years.

Though tolerant of other religions, the Church's ubiquity often seems to overwhelm other nascent cultures and religions.

### Roles
