## **Church of Caelum**

### Aura Sol Orbis

- **Race:** Aasimar, Female
- **Class:** Paladin (Oath of Redemption)
- **Background:** Exarch, Prefect of Caelum's Landing
- **Born:** [964 PO](timeline#964-po), [Caelum's Landing](locations#caelums-landing)

Aura Sol Orbis was born on the 14th day of Viridis in the [Oratory](locations#the-oratory) on Caelum's Landing. As the first of *Ardeat Sol Orbis*' four children, much of her upbringing was focused on preparing her for the day she would inevitably take over as *Exarch*. Though she shared a close relationship with her father, her politics would grow apart from his as she watched him champion the Church's expansionist practices and perpetuate the *Medusae Wars* until [983 PO](timeline#983-po).

Aura has warm-tinted brown skin and solid white eyes much like her father, and sports a long afro gathered into a high ponytail. She and her siblings bare the silver Sol Orbis halo on their foreheads. Those who are granted audience with Aura see her as a kind and understanding soul, while those closest to her know her to be solemn and somewhat lonesome.

Following the natural death of her father, Aura was heralded as the new Exarch in a grand coronation on the 11th day of Flavum, [986 PO](timeline#986-po). Accepting her crown, Aura took her chosen oath of redemption as a paladin of the Church, swearing to right the wrongs of the Medusae Wars and help those affected reintegrate into society. She would go on to declare her brother, [Spiro](#spiro-sol-orbis), Grand Paladin and Prefect of [Ingenium](locations#ingenium), her sibling, [Sana](#sana-sol-orbis), Prefect of [Madanau](locations#madanau) and her sister [Clara](#clara-sol-orbis), Prefect of [Tenebrae's Refuge](locations#tenebraes-refuge).

## **The Commission**

### Glimback Toestubber

- **Race:** Gnome, Male
- **Born:** 716 PO, Ingenium
- **Roles:** Founder of the Commission
- **Relationships:** Adelaide Burkhart, successor

Originally from Ingenium, Glimback was inspired in his youth when the city he called home was torn from one realm and deposited in another in a shower of sparks. He came to Caelum's Landing intent on forming the Relief's greatest explorer's guild. His vision became a reality when in 923 PO his organisation was commissioned by *Ardeat Sol Orbis*, the Exarch, to begin prospecting new earthmotes for colonisation. This eccentric, athletic and adventurous gnome always wears a smile to tint his pocked, rosy cheeks. Portraits of Glimback's many adventures adorn the wall of *Crowswood Place*. His silver widow's peak sticks up as though electrocuted and he is often seen wearing a backpack far too big for him, filled with tools for adventuring and tinkering. Glimback and an expedition of Crows went missing in 995 PO when they ventured into the Miasma.

### Adelaide Burkhart

- **Race:** Human, Female
- **Born:** 958 PO, Arx
- **Roles:** Chief of the Commission
- **Relationships:** Glimback Toestubber, predecessor

A soft-spoken but nonetheless strong and charismatic human, Adelaide Burkhart became the protege of Glimback Toestubber at the age of 19 when she discovered a lost expedition in Os Terrae. Demonstrating her survival knowledge and enthusiasm for adventure, Adelaide guided the expedition to her home city of Arx and earned the admiration of Glimback. Under his tutelage, Adelaide quickly became a capable fighter and wise leader. Adelaide often sports shoulder-length dark brown hair plaited so it doesn't cover her kindly amber eyes. Her unblemished bronze complexion belies her muscular figure.
