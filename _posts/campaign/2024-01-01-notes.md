## **Session 27 (996, Roscidas 21st-22nd)**

### Into Darkness

To prepare the earthmote for travel the *Six of Steel* may:

- Install pteranodon leather sails and thrusters. **Guy** may take the helm to practise steering. Monks can create winds.
- Install protective lanterns (once the Arxian glass is received).
- Install weaponry. Cannons and grappling hooks.
- Procure supplies. Food, drink and potions.
- Train and assign crew of 20.

The crew:
- **Commission**. Adelaide, Lathraia, Hadley, Doom, Tuperk.
- **Church**. Clara, Spiro?.
- **Monks**. Baihu, Keijo, Blue-belly, Jaytrix, Brazen.
- **Inventors.** Eureka, Zephan.

### Find Naal Berevan

Naal was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Constable *Denover*'s proposal to send in his own undercover agent was refused so he couldn't interfere.

- *Vetra Bery* may kidnap Blythe and try to recruit her for the submarine crew. They intend to mutiny and use the submarine to search for and recover the body of Tenebrae (Arzhang).
  - If Blythe refuses, Naal will cast modify memory on Blythe. Leaving a message about his progress which must be delivered to the Grand Inquisitor.
- Vetra tells of an expedition that returned with an artefact that was sealed away in the vault in 972 PO, the same year the Inquisition was founded.
- Vetra knows about the expedition. She foretells of Blythe joining the Crosscut Circle once she discovers the truth in the Miasma.

### Arti's Hearing

Tristis may attempt to read the thoughts of:

- **Blythe**. Leading to the arrest of Camren. The Inquisition may stop the submarine construction, leading the Crosscut Circle to act prematurely and steal the submarine. The Inquisition may try to retrieve the letter from the *Dawnroot Druids*.
- **Arti** or **Firien**. Leading to Tristis insisting an Inquisition representative join them to prevent activation of the pillar.

### Find Glimback

The expedition can be found holed up in an abandoned inn deep in the Miasma. The inn is regularly attacked by aberrations. Arti's heart protects them. Surviving expedition members include:

- *Glimback Toestubber*. Gnome artificer, head of the Commission.
- *Kalyptos*. Dragonborn monster slayer ranger, Caelum worshipper. Wayfarer who encouraged Glimback to leave Arti behind. Member of the Inquisition.
- *Owain*. Harengon wild magic sorcerer, stuck in scared rabbit form.
- *Tiamo Trouve*. Human watcher paladin. Exiled diamond guard and strict tactician.

If the pillar is found, *Kalyptos* will attempt to dissuade Arti from touching it. If unsuccessful, he will reveal his Inquisition badge and summon the Chimera.

### Anchorheart's Folly

*Lenna Madizos* was recently recalled from her work providing aid in the Manyshells and has been investigating why. Her only lead is the Church requisitioning vast amounts of Basilisk oil through independent guilds so it goes unnoticed. The basilisk oil is in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia, who have warriors that can petrify with their gaze.

**Guy**'s captain, *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing. Anchorheart has made a deal with Vasilissa. He offers resonite weapons and in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the Manyshells.

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry cannot confirm the existence of the fallen miner as there is no paperwork. Therefore, the implementation of better health and safety in the mines is on hold. The union holds regular strikes led by *Harbek Goldmask*. The miner who fell was an illusion created by an agent of the *Mining Consortium* in order to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from *Micantrum* instead of the *Garnetgrinder Clan*.

*Gerti Garnetgrinder* despises that she comes from a banking family. Her parents are from Xor, now settled in Ruby. She believes the Mining Consortium set up Snicker to create economic chaos. According to her, to create an illusion in the Resonant Mines would require a powerful wizard like *Havat Eilistre* or shape changer. A shape changer could change their voice, this does not explain why the victim didn't scream as he fell. Furthermore, a shape changer would require body reference.

Spiro intends to encourage his sister to intervene and give the miners the safety they need. Aura will instruct the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlaw monopolies on essential goods.

### Confront River Chapman

Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape. River Chapman may trap the party in his game room. They will face dice monsters on a chequerboard in the mirror plane.

Gomruss needs a key to the Plane of Mirrors. Research may uncover:
- An artefact buried in a tomb in Arx
- The Queen of Diamante's crown

The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees. The crown jewels will be on display, ripe for theft.

### Capture a Basilisk

A mission issued to the Commission by the Church of Caelum. Capture a Basilisk using an Imprison Creature scroll. The Church may be harvesting basilisk venom in preparation as tensions rise again with Mallia.

- Travel to 2d12 location by glider or airship.
- **Basilisk CR 2.** ***Bite.*** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d6+2 piercing + 2d6 poison.
- **Young Basilisk CR 1.** ***Bite.*** +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d4+1 piercing + 1d4 poison.
- Players must be careful of *petrifying gaze*

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* is offering work clearing out a buried tomb in Os Terrae. The airship to Arx won't depart until Darshan has finished his work at Crowswood Place. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

Bantonio may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*.

### Investigate Tensions on Atada

Tiamo Trouve was exiled when he lost a duel to *???*, the current head of the Diamond Guard. ??? is creating tensions with the Emmeraude Republic in order to declare martial law.
