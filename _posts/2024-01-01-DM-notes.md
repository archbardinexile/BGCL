### Session 1

##### **Prologue**

Almost 1,000 years ago, in a bid for power, the fiend *Tenebrae* conducted a dark ritual to grow the skeleton of a colossal war machine from the very earth beneath *Discidium*. Flying high above the *Oratory*, *Caelum Sol Orbis*, Grand Paladin, watched in horror as *Mundi Eversor* erupted from the ground and strode toward *Profundus* leaving volcanic ash in its wake. So great was Eversor in size that it seemed to rise from the horizon as great chunks of earth crumbled away from its metallic form.

Caelum and his winged paladins soared across the Altum Ocean to intercept the colossus. Engulfed in a radiant inferno, Caelum ascended to deliver a final blow to Eversor. The dark heart of Eversor exploded, releasing the *Miasma*, a harrowing purple fog that would engulf the land for centuries to come. The magical shock-wave enchanted deposits of *resonite* in the earth and the land began to fracture and rise, creating the *earthmotes*. As a fissure opened up around his home, Caelum stood at its centre and raised his wings. A mighty golden shield grew around Profundus, holding back the Miasma as the world transformed forever.

It is the 14th day of Roscidas, 996 PO, nearly one millennium after the *Rising*. Winter is coming to an end and six adventurers now make their way to Caelum's Landing in search of adventure.

##### **Zipper Pirate Attack**

- Players choose where to sit on the cable car
- Give opportunity for character description and conversation
- Explain view out of window

Looking out the window, you see the earthmote *Fundus*. It appears like a mighty inverted mountain in the clouds. Its underbelly glimmers with enchanted purple resonite ores. Fundus Park Station has vast rolling hills of patchwork farmland cut in two by the *Fountainhead River*, which diffuses into the air when it reaches the shore, nourishing a perpetual rainbow below. From this distance you can see the spire of the Oratory which sits at the centre of Caelum's Landing.

Directly beneath Fundus lie the *Resonant Mines*; the crater from which Fundus arose almost 1,000 years ago. The mine is a crystalline sinkhole with scaffolding spiralling down to seemingly never ending depths. Floating chunks of enchanted ore that have separated from Fundus litter the sky, appearing like an enormous explosion frozen in time.

Cable car stops: "Apologies for the delay everyone, there is a disruption ahead which we are working to resolve. We'll notify you when we are ready to get underway. Thank you." Pirates approach on cables using zip-wheels. They shatter the windows, enter and demand everyone's valuables.

- 5-7 **Bandits** and one **Bandit captain** with a *pistol (1d10 piercing, ammunition (30/90 ft.), loading)*
- Bandits send valuables down to earthmote below on parachutes
- Pirates do not negotiate
- Bandits can parachute away if frightened
- If pirates get away and party follows, roll 2d12 to determine destination. Proceed to **Fight at Pirate Drop-Off**.

**Unique action: zip-wheel.** You drop a handful of ball bearings into your zip-wheel while it spins at high speed. Ranged Weapon Attack: + DEX + PRO to hit, 15-foot cone. Hit: 3d4 bludgeoning. On natural 1: zip-wheel jams and must be repaired using an action.

##### **Fundus Park to Caelum's Landing**

Fundus Park has several amenities one might need after a lengthy journey. A tavern, several inns, even a tourist information centre. The park itself has rolling green hills and a lush pond with a statuesque fountain in the centre. There is an elderly dwarf selling ice cream. Past the park are fields of yellow rapeseed, maize, wheat and other cereals dotted with the windmill homes of farmers. The ruckus of the town is replaced with the chirps of grasshoppers when the party makes their way down the road.

- The *Inland Guard* will greet the party and ask for a report
- Players can choose to walk to Caelum's Landing or get a taxi: taxi holds 4, 6 silver per taxi.

Players enter the *Wind District* where shoppers and tourists can find the heart of the Relief's commerce. Players can find the stalls of travelling merchants, workshops of craftsmen from all over the Relief, and skilled alchemists who can both heal and invigorate the most daring of adventurers. Today is the Guilds Exhibition where guilds from all over the Relief can sell goods and recruit members.

**Attending guilds:**

- Church of Caelum, recruiting acolytes, accepting charity
- The Commission, recruiting explorers
- The Diamond Guard, recruiting squires

**Firien** heading to Church stall to sell cookies, relieve half-orc friend, **Grevik**
**??? (Oak)** might ask about *Naal Berevan* at the Church stall, Grevik believes Naal joined the Inquisition (Firien might know this)
**Arti** will vaguely recognise the "Commission", explorer at stall can direct them to Crowswood Place
**Guy** might ask where they can get a stonelock pistol, these are rare, manufactured in *Ingenium* and mainly used by high ranking members of the *Inland Guard*
**Bantonio** might try to avoid the CLU stall as Isabela, his sister, is a Professor of Philosophy there
**Gomruss** may encounter disgruntled gamblers or debt collectors looking to take their money

##### **Gomruss Gets Attacked**

- 2-4 drunken **Thugs** attack Gomruss when they recognise him. Gomruss owes the leader 20 gold
- Thugs use **Pack tactics** but unarmed strikes only unless the party retaliates with a weapon or magic
