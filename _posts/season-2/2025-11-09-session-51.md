title: Session 51 The Beach Episode
---

Regrouping in the gardens, the *Six of Steel* pay attention to **Guy** as he humbly requests their help. Sharing the letter he received, he explains that his wife, *Elyse*, may be in danger. Without hesitation, the party agree to accompany Guy on a quest to the *Manyshells*.

## **996, Inceptum 24th**

The following morning, **Firien** reunites with *Grevik*. Relieved the *Oratory* is open to the public once again, the shy half-orc offers his congratulations. Dean *Vance* also offers praise, but quickly relents when Firien explains they intend to visit the Manyshells. Though Vance questions Firien, he understands the need for secrecy.

Firien finds the Sol Orbis siblings bickering in *Aura*'s study. It seems *Spiro* is dissatisfied with *Tristis*' punishment—or lack thereof. He is angered further when Firien reveals that *Tristis* attacked the *Dawnroot Druids* and altered their memories to retrieve a secret letter. *Sana* vouches for *Roshia*'s reliable information.

> "This is troubling. We observe a treaty with the druids to uphold their independence. If Tristis is willing to break the law, that makes him a very dangerous man. I can see why you didn't want to raise this matter in the hearing."
>
> *Aura to Firien.*

Spiro pursues Firien as they leave the Oratory. With some hesitation, he asks if they might spend some time together before they leave for the Manyshells. Endeared by the Grand Paladin's fumbled words, Firien invites him to their favourite tavern, *The Dragon's Chalice*. Enjoying a meal at an outdoor restaurant nearby, **Bantonio** and **Blythe** coo in unison when they spot the smitten pair.

### Bandorul Estate

Meanwhile, **Gomruss** returns home to the proud embrace of his parents. *Roolu* has prepared Gomruss' favourite meal while *Jaagins* is set to chronicle his adventure in the family scrapbook. Though Gomruss must omit certain revelations, his parents are transfixed by the tale. Jaagins guffaws when Gomruss enacts shooting a fireball down a morkoth's urethra. Roolu's eyes sparkle at the treasures her son liberated from its lair.

Jaagins bristles when Gomruss announces his quest to the Manyshells. Turning several pages of his scrapbook, Jaagins presents the Bandorul family tree. He points out his eccentric half brother, *Bidreked*, who apparently fled to the Manyshells tempted by the Bitch Queen's offered fortune. Jaagins expresses his confidence in Gomruss, but warns of *Umberlee*'s indiscriminate wrath.

## **996, Inceptum 25th**

While **Arti** enjoys a day of rest with his father, Guy, Bantonio and Blythe head to the market to replenish their ammunition.
