## **Double or Nothing**

*1st-level divination*

- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take after making an attack roll
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Whenever you make an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll an additional d20. You can cast this spell after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll. If the attack hits, it becomes a critical hit. If the attack misses, you have disadvantage on your next attack roll. You can't cast this spell in reaction to an attack roll that already has advantage or disadvantage.
