title: Session 23 A Brush with the Law
---

*Eureka* embraces **Arti** before the *Six of Steel* take their leave. Keen to investigate the submarine, **Blythe** consults **Guy**, the designated navigator. Guy plots a route via the *Ingenium Inventors Association* so he might surreptitiously scout the factory where the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle is stored. Peering through his spyglass from the cable car window, Guy spies a lengthy queue at the entrance to the IIA building. **Firien** suggests the party visit the exhibition as they want to purchase new cooking appliances for their family bakery. Without a second thought, Guy agreesâ€”Firien had handed him the perfect excuse.

The party each receive a stamp for two silver and are allowed to enter. At first, Firien is overwhelmed by the crowd but quickly finds the cooking aisle. Sensing some subterfuge from the self-proclaimed pirate, Arti tries to follow Guy but the half-elf merges into the crowd with surprising stealth. Blythe approaches a monocled human demonstrating a portable spyglass. His excitement grows when she takes interest in the *Magnus 3000*, a hefty magnifying glass with a built-in head-up display. Meanwhile, **Gomruss** makes conversation with a goliath wizard and purchases a convenient belt holster for his spellbook. On the lookout for gadgets that could help the Crows, Arti finds the pet aisle. He commissions the creation of a gyro-stabilised bird cage with an automated feeder for *Addie*.

Removing his hat to blend in with a crowd of investors, Guy watches *Brogar Stonehelm*'s demonstration of his prototype rifle. Stonehelm places the rifle in a glass case and activates an arcane lock once the demonstration is over. Guy strokes his chin. Perhaps **Bantonio**'s resonite pendant could dispel the lock? He finds the hopeless romantic cooing over a mechanical horse. A groom from Diamante demonstrates the brass beauty's unique features: 60 litres of cargo space, beginner and advanced rider modes, and folding legs for convenient storage.

Bantonio returns from his test ride and Guy seizes the opportunity to pickpocket his pendant and whip. While the groom is distracted, Guy climbs into the horse's storage compartment, unnoticed. The Six of Steel gather to share what they have purchased. Firien's bag of holding is now laden with cookware. Arti and Gomruss decide to accompany Firien to the job centre where they might find *Snicker Nickelfoot*, while Blythe requests Bantonio's help investigating the submarine. Before they leave, Guy opens a flap in the horse's stomach to whisper his plan to Blythe.

> "Psst. Psst, Blythe. It's me, Guy. I'm in the horse."
>
> "Why are you in the horse?"
>
> "It's clop secret."
>
> *Guy to Blythe.*

### Job Centre

Weary from the cable car ride, Gomruss bellows Snicker's name to save time. Dismissing the disgruntled glares, Gomruss spots the deep gnome speaking with a well-dressed drow. The two shake hands before the drow leaves. Firien asks Snicker for his version of events. Snicker is reluctant at first, quoting the many thugs and journalists that have already approached him. He opens up when Firien explains they are not with the Church, they are conducting their own investigation.

> "I've been beaten up so many times I don't know what I saw any more. I didn't know the guy, a dwarf he was with a big round beard. He didn't even scream when he fell."
>
> *Snicker explains what he saw.*

Something chimes in Gomruss' mind. Perhaps the miner could not scream because he was an illusion? Then again, it would be difficult to cast such an illusion deep inside the *Resonant Mines*. When asked about the well-dressed drow, Snicker reveals that they offered him a job with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*. Gomruss' eyes grow wide when he recalls his encounter with the governor of *Micantrum*, a powerful illusion wizard. Keen to discourage Snicker from signing up with another exploitative mining business, Firien drops a gold pouch into the deep gnome's hands and tells tales of a baker's life on *Madanau*.
