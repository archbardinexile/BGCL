### Crowswood Place

While **Arti** lies dormant in *Hadley*'s workshop, their memories become clearer as they begin to dream. A dense purple fog clouds their vision as they lie on stone cold ground. A diminutive figure approaches and crouches over them. The face of *Glimback Toestubber* fills their vision, tears in his eyes, his cheeks ruddy and weathered.

> "I'm so sorry, little one. I'll be back for you, I promise."
> 
> *Glimback to Arti.*

Unable to move, Arti sees Glimback lift the magical lantern from their chest and dart back into the Miasma. He and a group of six or more crows are being pursued by harrowing inhuman sounds. As Glimback moves away with the lantern, so does its sphere of influence, and Arti's vision is eventually consumed by the Miasma.

The next face Arti sees is unfamiliar, incomplete even. Within the confines of the dream Arti can only register an abnormally tall, lanky figure with long greasy hair that covers half of its green-tinted face. Arti is unsure how much time has passed since Glimback left. The figure looms over them and taps the alcove in their chest with long spindly fingers.

> "What have we here? Don't worry, little one. I'll take care of you."
> 
> *Mysterious figure to Arti.*
