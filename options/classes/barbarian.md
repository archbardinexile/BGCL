## [**Barbarian Class Features**](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#barbarian_phb)

### Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the ***Player's Handbook*** when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a barbarian. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

#### **Primal Healing (Optional)**

Starting at 7th level, you can end your rage with a healing impulse as a bonus action. Up to six creatures of your choice that can hear you within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to 1d8 Ã— your remaining rages. You can reduce the targets' psychosis level by 1, or end one of the following effects on each of the targets: blinded, deafened, paralysed, or poisoned.
