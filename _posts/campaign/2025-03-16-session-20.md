title: Session 20 Denover's Dilemma
---

Constable *Denover* clears his throat to interrupt **Blythe** and **Firien**'s hushed whispers. The pair reveal that *Falvalor* came to Blythe in hopes she might help find his friend *Naal*. Blythe offers Naal's letter to the constable but chooses to withhold the letter she took from *Camren*'s office. Denover strokes his chin. Could Naal be working for the Inquisition? Despite the Inquisition's involvement, Denover seems intent on continuing his investigation. Firien glares and attempts to dissuade the constable from chasing a promotion. Denover agrees to discontinue his investigation and instead offers Blythe a sending stone to keep him apprised of her own investigations.

### Crowswood Place

The *Six of Steel* return to *Crowswood Place* and are quickly invited to share in a delicious meal prepared by *Subira*. **Arti** sits beside *Hadley* and *Doom* and recounts the events of their lucid dream at the *Spirit Temple*. The two Crows examine Arti's drawings of the monster that paralysed them. Doom recognises the monster as a chimera, deformed and driven mad by Miasma psychosis. Arti theorises that the dream visitor might be related in some way to *Saint Lydia*, given they heard the shadowy figure humming *Saint Lydia's Song*. Hadley points out that the dream visitor must be at least 200 years older than Saint Lydia if they used the ancient name for Caelum's Landingâ€”Anfang.

Hadley further proposes that Arti may have simply imagined their connection to the dream visitor, as the shadowy figure revealed nothing Arti did not already know, but Arti is sceptical. The cogs now turn in **Gomruss**' head as he considers what his mentor taught him about chronurgy and the manipulation of time. He declares that time has no meaning in one's own mindscape. If indeed Arti was connected to the dream visitor in some way, their knowledge may not be limited to the confines of the dream.

Subira praises **Bantonio** for helping her with the washing up. Before retiring with the others, Arti pulls *Lathraia* aside to show him the more detailed drawing of the dream visitor. Lathraia confirms Arti's suspicions. It appears as though the dream visitor has found a way to inhibit the long-term effects of Miasma psychosis, perhaps by containing it to one half of their body, though how he does not know. While Subira douses the candles, Arti sneaks off to the library. They find several books with references to Saint Lydia, including *A Brief History of Fio*.

> The desert oasis Madanau appears erde-west of Fundus in a whirlwind of sand. Initially submerged in the Miasma, the enormous emerald dragon, Vulcan, emerges from his dormancy to push Madanau beyond the barrier with his hurricane-like breath. Few denizens of Madanau see the dragon before he returns to his slumber beneath Montanum, but those that did have passed on the tale for generations. Cor Sol Orbis chooses to send aid to Madanau but is met with adversity. Lydia Iremia, a curious earth genasi healer from Montanum, sets out on a journey to aid the denizens of Madanau. There she meets Cor Sol Orbis, who attempts to convince Madanau to accept Church aid and the construction of an embassy. Sensing Cor's intent to be benevolent, Lydia convinces the people of Madanau to accept the Church's offer.
