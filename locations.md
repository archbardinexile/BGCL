## **Profundus**

Profundus is the largest region at the centre of the [Relief](getting-started#the-relief). It plays host to one of the largest and most populous cities in the Relief, [Caelum's Landing](#caelums-landing), the capital city of [Fundus](#fundus). Adventurers and tourists can take advantage of sprawling markets and travel the [Innermotes](#the-innermotes) on powered cable cars.

### Fundus

Sat at the centre of the Relief, the [earthmote](getting-started#earthmotes) Fundus appears to those sailing the [Altum Sea](locations#altum-sea) below as a mighty inverted mountain in the clouds. Nearly 170 miles wide, the earthmote's underbelly glimmers with the enchanted [resonite](getting-started#resonance-engines) ores that keep it afloat. Fundus is also the colloquial term for the vast stretches of farmland that constitute a majority of the earthmote's south-western region. Here, scattered windmills serve as the primary residences for farmers and fishermen.

#### **Caelum’s Landing**

Sitting atop Fundus, Caelum's Landing is the capital city of the most prevalent nation and religion in the Relief, the [Church of Caelum](factions#church-of-caelum), which rose to power when [Caelum Sol Orbis](getting-started#caelum-sol-orbis) ascended to shield Fundus from the growing [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma) almost 1,000 years ago. Once known as *Anfang*, the city serves as the beating economic and cultural heart of the vast floating archipelagos that constitute the Relief. Caelum's Landing is home to nearly 1,000,000 people of countless races and cultures. Caelum's Landing boasts 1,000 square miles of developed areas, making it the largest city in the Profundus region.

To the south-west, vast rolling hills of patchwork farmland are cut in two by the [River Fountainhead](#river-fountainhead), which diffuses into the air when it reaches the shore, nourishing a perpetual rainbow below. To the east, the industrial, residential and commercial districts of Caelum's Landing are framed by the [Dawnroot Forest](#dawnroot-forest) where the [Dawnroot Druids](factions#dawnroot-druids) protect the River's sacred source.

##### The Oratory

The Oratory stands at the centre of Caelum's Landing, a great spire serving as the seat of the Church of Caelum and the residence of the Exarch, [Aura Sol Orbis](church-of-caelum#aura-sol-orbis). Here, hopeful acolytes train to become clerics in service to Caelum.

##### Ministerial Houses

North of Caelum's Landing, the Ministerial Houses play host to the nation's government; a council of elected ministers representing the many provinces under the Church's jurisdiction. Their Chairman, [Emil Hartmann](characters#emil-hartmann) serves as head of government.

##### Cloud District

The Cloud District is where Caelum's Landing's industry takes precedence. It lies north-east of the Oratory. At its centre can be found the main office, barracks and stables of the [Inland Guard](factions#inland-guard). Further east, [resonance engines](getting-started#resonance-engines) and other contraptions are constructed at Caelum's Landing's acclaimed steam factories, where airships can be seen departing from vast airfields.

##### Sun District

The Sun District is the largest of Caelum's Landing's districts, where one can find residences and public services to sate any need. Inns always have beds and taverns always have beer. Street carts can be caught to travel anywhere on Fundus, and powered street lighting will keep your journey illuminated at night.

##### Wind District

The Wind District is where shoppers and tourists can find the heart of the Relief's commerce. South-west of the Oratory, it is commonplace to find the stalls of travelling merchants, workshops of craftsmen from all over the Relief, and skilled alchemists who can both heal and invigorate the most daring of adventurers.

##### Caelum’s Landing University

Caelum’s Landing University, or CLU, is large enough to warrant a district of its own. Isolated north-west of the Oratory, here you can take crash courses to learn new spells, gain new skills and new tool proficiencies. Or, if you wish to carve out a different path for yourself, you may enrol at the university and learn all the essential skills you need to make a fresh start. The university's famous library and observatory are always open to the public. Adventurers looking to travel to other earthmotes may also visit the *Glider Proficiency Centre*, where they must pass an assessment before they are given a glider of their own.

##### Crowswood Place

Crowswood Place is the stately manor home of the [Commission](factions#the-commission) for the Research of Offshore Worlds, or Crows for short. Situated west of the Oratory, members of this organisation are are tasked with surveying the earthmotes in the far reaches of unexplored territory. Crowswood Place is also home to a clandestine lodge of blood hunters known as the [Order of the Lantern](factions#order-of-the-lantern). These hunters elect to undergo a curious ritual of their own design which allows them to navigate the depths of the Miasma.

#### **Sundered Peaks**

These three peaks on Fundus' northern shore are what remains of a mountain range that crumbled away during the [Rising](timeline#the-rising).

##### Ruins of Caer Wraidd

This ancient citadel was carved into the stone of the Sundered Peaks perhaps more than two millennia ago. It was the residence of *Anfarwol*, the immortal elf-king of Anfang. It is now a site of great archaeological interest.

#### **Fundus Park**

Fundus Park is a small town on the south-western shore of Fundus constructed around the first cable car station on the *Calligo Way*. It has several amenities one might need after a lengthy journey. A tavern, several inns, even a tourist information centre. The park itself has rolling green hills and a lush pond with a statuesque fountain in the centre. Beyond the park can be found patchwork fields of yellow rapeseed, maize, wheat and other cereals dotted with the windmill homes of farmers.

#### **Spirit Temple**

The [Spirit Temple](factions#spirit-temple) is the isolated home of a clique of monks on the north-western shore. The monks there seek a deep connection to [Fio](getting-started#fio) through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands, making them fertile and bountiful. Though not followers of Caelum, the monks remain in the employ of the Church when rogue earthmotes threaten to collide with Fundus. The monks' combined strength allows them to arrest dangerous earthmotes and send them back into the Miasma.

#### **River Fountainhead**

On the south-western shore, a great waterfall is fuelled by the River Fountainhead that leads north-east to the Dawnroot Forest. Along the river can be found numerous fishing villages and watermills.

#### **Dawnroot Forest**

A statue of Caelum presides over the entrance to the Dawnroot Forest. The River Fountainhead leads north-east to its source; a portal to the elemental plane of water.

##### Pen Ffynnon

In the heart of the Dawnroot Forest lies Pen Ffynnon, the ancestral home of the [Dawnroot druids](factions#dawnroot-druids). These druids are sworn to protect and nurture the portal in the centre of Lake Fountainhead.

### Resonant Mines

Directly beneath Caelum's Landing lie the Resonant Mines; the crater from which Fundus arose almost 1,000 years ago. The mine is a crystalline sinkhole with scaffolding spiralling down to seemingly never ending depths. Budding and experienced miners alike will always find work here, but the precarious work conditions can often prove taxing, sometimes fatal. Surrounding the Resonant Mines, the [Altum Sea](#altum-sea) threatens to fill the sinkhole and wash away miners with every passing tide. Maintaining the barricades that keep the sea at bay is a strenuous job in itself. Above, floating chunks of enchanted ore that separated from Fundus 1,000 years ago litter the sky. To passing sailors, the mines appear to be an enormous explosion frozen in time.

### The Innermotes

The Innermotes are Caelum's Landing's nearest neighbours, connected to Fundus by the *Calligo Way*, a network of powered cable cars and zip lines. The Church's territories are also connected by teleportation circles, generously established by the mages of [Caelum's Landing University](#caelums-landing-university). All of the Church's territories are governed or supervised by a *Prefect*, appointed by the Church.

#### **Tenebrae’s Refuge**

Tenebrae’s Refuge is said to be the place to which [Tenebrae](getting-started#tenebrae) fled when their colossal war machine was defeated almost 1,000 years ago. At only a third its size, this earthmote sits to the erde-south-west of Fundus, in its shadow. As such, its terrain is rocky with little in the way of vegetation. Its primary industry has always been the mining of resonite. [Clara Sol Orbis](characters#clara-sol-orbis) is the current Prefect of Tenebrae's Refuge. As with all of the Church's territories, followers of Caelum constitute a fair proportion of the population on Tenebrae's Refuge, though followers of other religions are welcomed and accepted. Where on Caelum's Landing you would find an abundance of races who make their homes under the sun, on Tenebrae's Refuge you would more commonly find races more comfortable in the darkness.

#### **Little Nox**

Little Nox separated from Tenebrae's Refuge around the year [617 PO](timeline#617-po). This was caused by the Fountainhead Falls above eroding a chasm between the two earthmotes. Erde-south-east of Tenebrae's Refuge, Little Nox is only a fifth of its size. Half of Little Nox remains directly beneath the rainbow of Fountainhead Falls. The prismatic mist and resplendent pond at the earthmote's centre make it the perfect habitat for aquatic races.

#### **Ingenium**

Ingenium appeared in the skies north-east of Fundus in the year [748 PO](timeline#748-po), bringing with it a sprawling brass metropolis and a displaced but technologically advanced culture. Facing an energy crisis, they sought the assistance of the Church while they acclimated to the new world in which they found themselves. An agreement with Caelum's Landing was reached in [756 PO](timeline#756-po), and with the help of the monks of the Spirit Temple, the earthmote Ingenium was moved to Fundus' north-eastern shore. [Spiro Sol Orbis](church-of-caelum#spiro-sol-orbis) is Ingenium's current Prefect.

### Atada

#### **Kingdom of Diamante**

##### Diamond Palace

##### College of Retainers

#### **Duchy of Zaffiro**

#### **Émeraude Republic**

### Atado

#### **Duchy of Ruby**

Separated from the earthmote [Atada](#atada), the Duchy of Ruby sits atop the earthmote Atado.

### The Outermotes

The Outermotes are the territories of the Church that can only be reached by airship or glider. Though the Church has established a presence in these regions, their distance from Caelum's Landing and lack of Church involvement can sometimes invite apostasy.

#### **Micantrum**

Micantrum is the smallest of the Church's territories at only 50 miles in diameter. The earthmote can be described as a floating geode north-east of Fundus. It is spherical in shape, with several tunnel entrances that lead inside to the 1,000 storied rings that form a disreputable mining metropolis. Inside, crystals are illuminated by an artificial moon hanging at the earthmote's centre, created by Micantrum's current governor, the philandering tiefling wizard, [Havat Eilistre](characters#havat-eilistre). Under his administration, Micantrum has become a lawless place of debauchery, gambling and fornication. Denizens can even be found battling for riches in Micantrum's infamous gladiatorial arena.

The Church maintains a trade presence through Micantrum's Prefect, [Luna Vigil](characters#luna-vigil). However, much to the Church's disdain, they were recently revealed to have become Eilistre's mistress. Many believe it is this affair that has caused Micantrum's reputation to fall into its current state. Thanks to its seclusion, many races who prefer to live in darkness make their home in Micantrum.

#### **Madanau**

Madanau has been revealed by scholars to be one of the first earthmotes to arrive in Fio during [Caelum's Light](getting-started#caelums-light). Estimated to be nearly 800 years old, this desert earthmote lies far erde-west of Caelum's Landing, treacherously close to the Miasma. Madanau has made its name as a valued hub of trade, able to grow and export exotic fruits and spices that cannot be found anywhere else in the Relief. The grand, circular oasis at Madanau's centre hosts a portal to the elemental plane of water, providing an abundance of fresh water and delicious fish. However, in [996 PO](timeline#996-po) the portal was damaged by a falling shard from a rogue earthmote. Under the administration of [Sana Sol Orbis](characters#sana-sol-orbis) the citizens of the ancient desert earthmote were able to stabilise the portal.

#### **Creed's Hollow**

Stabilised skew-east of Madanau, Creed's Hollow emerged from the Miasma in a ring of hellfire in 996 PO. The earthmote flew over Madanau and rained imps from the *Nine Hells* down upon its citizens. Though Madanau was able to repel the attack, the oasis at its centre was damaged by a shard of hellish black rock that fell from the rogue earthmote. With the imps defeated, monks of the Spirit Temple were able to arrest the earthmote and greet its denizens. The Church's ambassadors were met by a village of tiefling farmers who, until recently, had been living in seclusion in Avernus, free of *Zariel*'s rule. Creed's Hollow enjoys healthy relations with the Church, and trades in agricultural produce native to the Nine Hells.

### Altum Sea

The Altum Sea stretches far into the uncharted regions of the Miasma. As a result, most denizens of the Relief tend to have at least a rudimentary understanding of seafaring or aviation. The destruction of Mundi Eversor wrought great storms that filled the cavities left behind after the rising, leading many aquatic races to take refuge in its depths. To this day, the many shantytowns that lie beneath the ocean remain mysteriously isolated.

### Sylvan Kingdoms

## **Calidus**

Calidus, the southernmost region, is blanketed by harsh sands, yet many varied cultures thrive here. The sandstone city of [Arx](#arx) offers refuge to travellers while powerful fiends are said to watch with envious eyes from the darkened landscape beyond the Miasma.

### Arx

This city of sandstone is second only to Caelum's Landing when it comes to its abundance of culture and trade. Arx's increasing rate of growth can be attributed to more and more curious travellers discovering, contributing and advertising the wealth of food, art and community spirit the city has to offer. A frequent saying amongst the denizens of Calidus goes: "A friend made in Arx is a friend for life." The saying may have been coined by foreign traders sharing tales of almost succumbing to Calidus' draining environs before generous Arxmen offered them shelter. Arx's most wealthy patron and unofficial governor of sorts is [Shadal ibn Lakhim](characters#shadal-ibn-Lakhim), who has invested much of his fortune into developing Arx into a utopian refuge amidst the sands of Calidus.

### Os Terrae

Often besieged by howling sandstorms, a portal to the elemental plane of earth marks the centre of the desolate Os Terrae region. Local Githzechi tribes call this giant sinkhole "shka'keth" meaning asshole. Debris litters the landscape, believed to be the remains of a dead god which fell through a portal to the astral plane.

### Bone Cay

## **Contritus**

Contritus, the easternmost region, is broken by the far-reaching fjords and archipelagos of the [Manyshells](#the-manyshells). To the south-east, the enormous jungle earthmote [Mallia](#mallia) appears to drain the sea with curtains of vines that veil its shores.

### The Manyshells

This archipelago of diminutive isles spans most of the eastern Altum Sea, reaching even beyond the Miasma. The isles range from 60 miles wide to as little as a half-mile wide, broken by exponentially branching rivers of sparkling aquamarine. With no singular form of government, the Manyshells have become a reliable refuge for pirates, cultists, adrenaline junkies and other counter cultures.

#### **Raptor Island**

The largest of the Manyshells, Raptor Island, hosts the shanty city of [Anchora](#anchora), surreptitiously ruled by the [Confederacy of Privateers](factions#confederacy-of-privateers); a loose alliance of pirates, privateers and merchant crews governed by those with the largest fleets and the greatest wealth.

##### Anchora

### Mallia

Erupting from the sea erde-south-east of Fundus in the year [976 PO](timeline#976-po), Mallia is the largest earthmote in the Relief. This impenetrable jungle peninsula floats just above sea level, with thick vines cascading over its shores like medusan hair. The landmass continues into the Miasma, but none on the earthmote dare venture past the border. It is the home of the Mallian culture, a unification of reptilian races ruled by the greater medusan queen, [Vasilissa](characters#vasilissa). The queen is known to bless only the most powerful and loyal of her subjects with the very curse she bears in order to create the infamous medusan warriors that command her armies. Mallia currently stands fractured between those loyal to the queen and those who have found sanctuary in the Church of Caelum. The rainforest serves as the border between these two factions.

## **Montanum**

Montanum, to the west, is characterised by its expansive mountain ranges. Though much of the region is obscured by the Miasma, the peninsula of [Porta Ignota](#porta-ignota) serves as an invaluable trade hub for intrepid explorers of the magical purple fog.

### Porta Ignota

### Vena trench

The largest congregation of sea-folk in the Relief resides at the bottom of the Vena Trench. This mysterious underwater city has been named [Abyssus](#abyssus) by explorers that have until recently only inferred its existence. Not much is known about the city, other than it lies east of Mundi Eversor.

#### **Abyssus**

Expeditions to this underwater city have been met with adversity, trying to combat the pressure of the trench's depths and indeed its protective citizens. In [990 PO](timeline#990-po), an advanced submarine made by Ingenium's top artificers succeeded in capturing an image of the city from above, revealing curious illuminated domed structures like the tops of jellyfish. The submarine was subsequently attacked on its return journey by merfolk riding giant sharks. Fortunately, the crew was able to escape unharmed.

## **Glacialis**

Glacialis, the frozen region to the north, suffers arctic climates that have moulded its denizens into a force of nature. The stalwart people of [Nox](#nox) look upon the [Relief](getting-started#the-relief) through rings of aurora, while further east, the dinosaur-riding clans of [Primal Antiqua](#primal-antiqua) thrive on more verdant land.

### Nox

Skew-north of Fundus, Nox is a fiercely independent and somewhat impoverished city state founded by the reclusive silver dragon, [Nox](characters#nox). Nox does not rule the earthmote with his namesake. Rather, he presides over the commune as an adviser and mentor. This snow-capped earthmote sits high enough in the sky that its denizens may live under a perpetual night sky, illuminated only by a thin blue halo of daylight and ribbons of chromatic aurora.

Only a small proportion of the earthmote is populated. Wooden longhouses strengthened against bitter winds serve as the primary homes for the citizens of Nox. When the winter solstice arrives, citizens must shelter with the silver dragon in the belly of the earthmote. The cold climate also makes cultivating the land difficult. Nox is home to many avian and draconic races and those that prefer colder climates.

### Primal Antiqua

### Frozen Antiqua

## **Discidium**

Discidium, though completely engulfed by the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma), can still be seen beyond the barrier to the south-west as the red glow of lava and lightning storms illuminate the purple fog. At the centre of Discidium lies the crater from which Mundi Eversor emerged 1,000 years ago.

### Mundi Eversor

To the erde-south-west, the derelict remains of the ancient colossus, Mundi Eversor, can still be seen protruding from the sea. Above sea level, great metallic blades curve into an enormous rib cage formation, large enough to fit Fundus within. Scholars have discovered further remains in the depths of the Altum sea and estimate the colossus to have been ten times the size of Fundus. The landmass is too unstable to house a settlement, but here you may find expeditions looking to further chart the expanse of Eversor's remains, or pilgrims from wayward cults searching for enlightenment amidst the magical energies that linger there to this day.

### Tamlo

### Xor
