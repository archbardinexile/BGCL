## **Arcane Tradition**

### Lapidurgy

A lapidurge studies and shapes gemstones in great detail in order to achieve magical effects. The practice originated in Atada, where sparkling mineral deposits gave rise to the formidable *Diamond Guard*, who use gemstones to conjure radiant staves in defence of their queen.

#### **Gem Magic**

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you receive a set of four gemstones. You also gain proficiency with ***jeweller’s tools*** which you can use to study and modify the appearance of your gemstones. Whenever you cast a spell that sheds light, a gemstone of your choice is illuminated. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ***light points*** which you can spend to cast gem magic. Your light points cannot exceed the number of gemstones you have.

**Chromatic Ray.** As a bonus action, spend 1 light point. A beam of coloured light streaks toward a creature within 60 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d6 damage. Choose one of your gemstones. It determines the attack's damage type, as shown in the table below. The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**Refract Light.** As a reaction when a creature casts a spell that forces you or another creature within 30 feet to make a saving throw, spend 2 light points. That creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. Choose one of your gemstones. Until the end of your next turn, the triggering creature becomes vulnerable to the damage type of your chosen gemstone.

**Luminous Weapon (6th level required).** As an action, spend 4 light points. A non-magical weapon within 5 feet becomes a magic weapon. For 1 hour, the attacker can use their spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls of attacks using that weapon, and the weapon deals an extra 1d4 damage when it hits. Choose one of your gemstones. It determines the damage type of attacks using that weapon.

#### **Dancing Gems**

Starting at 2nd level, you learn the ***dancing lights*** cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You can dismiss dancing lights as part of the same action you use to cast it. When you do, you gain 4 light points.

#### **Prismatic Armour**

Starting at 6th level, you can adorn your clothing with luminous armour plating. As an action, choose one of your gemstones. For 8 hours, your base AC becomes 13 + your spellcasting modifier and you have resistance against the damage type of your chosen gemstone. The spell ends if you don armour or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

#### **Stonecutter**

Starting at 10th level, you learn how to transmute gemstones into their mineral counterparts, unlocking their damage types. You can transmute up to three gemstones when you finish a long rest, provided you have the material components. Diamond does not have a mineral counterpart and therefore cannot be transmuted.

#### **Gemstone Turret**

Starting at 14th level,
