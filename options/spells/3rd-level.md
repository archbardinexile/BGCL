## **Bandorulâ€™s Surface Shift**

*3rd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A drop of lemon oil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a medium size or lower creature that you can see within range. For the duration, you change the direction of gravity for that creature and it is pulled toward a vertical surface or ceiling within 60 feet of it. A willing creature may move up, down, across or upside down along that surface normally. An unwilling creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 force damage and falls toward the surface. At the end of the fall, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 6d6. It also lands prone, unless it somehow avoided taking damage from the fall. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

## **Bandorul's Unlocked Potential**

*3rd-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shamrock leaf, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature that you can see within range. For the duration, when that creature makes a successful attack roll, it can roll ***lucky dice*** in place of the normal damage dice of its weapon or spell. Lucky dice are never rolled in place of damage dice from an item's magical properties (e.g. from attunement, charges etc.).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bonus increases according to the lucky dice table. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bonus increases according to the lucky dice table.
