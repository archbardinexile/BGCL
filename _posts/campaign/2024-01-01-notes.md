### Quests

##### **Beckonhand's Treasure**

*Silas*, *Kurt*'s adopted nephew, came to the lighthouse to discover Kurt creating a will. Silas sees Kurt has written a puzzle for *Cade*, his son, as a clue to the whereabouts of his treasure. Solving the puzzle, Silas decides to rewrite the will, sending his cousin into a trap while he goes to find the real treasure. He then pushes Kurt out of the lighthouse window.

The real will pointed to a cave on *Little Nox*, where Kurt has stashed the loot from his pirating days; various magical items and ***6000 gold***.

- Silas has been gradually moving his father's loot to a new location.
- If discovered at Little Nox, Silas will claim to be visiting the spot where he and Kurt went fishing.
- Interrogating Silas will reveal his resentment of Cade. Living and caring for a broken Kurt drove Silas to madness.
- If accused, Silas may answer "Why would I kill him if I wasn't in the will?" He shouldn't know there was a will.

  - **Elvish glass cloak.** Can cast ***Mirror Image*** once a day.

- Blythe may speak with Camren, deputy minister of Tenebrae's Refuge, who will acknowledge a friendship with Naal but deny involvement in his disappearance.
  - Camren leads the Crosscut Circle on Tenebrae's Refuge.
- If able to search Camren's quarters, Blythe may find a panel in Camren's office requires a *Crosscut Circle* to be drawn to open it.
  -  It contains correspondence that concerns failure to determine the existence of an "asset." Images taken from above Ingenium of a vehicle under construction.
