### Seventh Pillar

**Bantonio** stumbles back as the sounds of battle once again overwhelm his senses. Examining the pillar before him, he realises the celestial script is now illuminated. Cornered by the basilisk, *Kalyptos* risks revealing his eyes. He gazes at the monstrosity, shaking off petrified scales as he casts banishment. The basilisk wails as it disappears inside **Gomruss**' die. Kalyptos turns his gaze to *Glimback*. He lunges forward, attempting to grapple the gnome, but Glimback slips between the Inquisitor's legs. Glimback touches the pillar. His eyes gloss over momentarily and the primordial script illuminates. He calls out to his friends.

> "Arti! Arti needs his heart!"
>
> "SPIRO! GET YOUR ARSE UP HERE!"
>
> *Glimback. Gomruss summons Spiro.*

The Inquisitor gives chase but is waylaid by **Firien**'s claw of *Bahamut*. Unable to move, **Arti** watches in horror as new limpid, vestigial heads grow from the chimera's open wounds. They strike his friends, incapacitating **Blythe** and critically wounding Firien! Though the chimera's poison threatens to overwhelm them, Firien stands resolute. They block the chimera's final attack, stealing a moment to cast cure wounds. **Guy** equips his gemlock pistol to defend Firien from afar, putting another bullet in the fleshy dragon head.

Dispelling his invisibility, Bantonio ambushes Kalyptos, bringing his flaming longsword down to disarm the Inquisitor. Kalyptos roars in pain, blood pouring from his wound, yet he keeps hold of his scimitar. Too weak to retaliate, he instead stirs up the ash at his feet to conceal his desperate escape. Bantonio calls out to his friends. Kalyptos had the chimera's die! They could use it to banish the aberration!

Suddenly, the sky is bathed in radiant light as *Spiro* soars above them carrying Arti's heart! He quickly assesses the battlefield and finds Arti in danger. Folding his wings, he dives toward Arti and slams the heart into his chest! The light intensifies immediately. Spiro staggers back as Arti begins to rise into the air. The battlefield falls silent as the magical fibres in Arti's chest wrap around his heart and begin to weave muscles around his joints. Within moments, Arti's entire body is engulfed by the light.

### Dreamscape

When Arti next opens his eyes, *Ten* stands before him in the dreamscape. A question enters his mind. Who am I? He considers his former life as *Arthur Toestubber* and the unwavering love of his father, Glimback. He recalls his journey as Arti the warforged, cherishing the friends he made along the way. Finally, he smiles at Ten, who made this all possible. By his own will, Arti's transformation shall reflect the impressions made on him by those he loves.

> "Congratulations, Arti. I can't tell you how thankful I am. Now... breathe."
>
> *Ten tears up.*

### Seventh Pillar

Arti inhales deeply, momentarily stunned by the sensation of air in their lungs. Pulses of radiant light wash over the *Six of Steel*, reinvigorating them while searing the chimera's flesh. As Arti's feet touch the grass, the light wanes. In the warforged's place stands a tall, humanoid figure with gnome-like ears, curly hair and a crown of gemstones. Much like Ten, one half of their face bears a green tint.

***The party advances to 6th level!***

Supercharged by Arti's light, Gomruss points at the chimera.
