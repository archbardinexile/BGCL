A letter from Elyse Trelawney to Guy Brush.

> I sincerely hope you are alive to receive this letter so that you may come to understand how much I have on my mind without you weighing on it further. Why must you be so enigmatic? Having said that, I find myself in the lamentable position of needing your help. Though for what I cannot say by letter.

> The Marley is headed for Enys Reunel. Please meet me at Rose Merryn’s Pre-Loved Goods if and when you return from your journey. I ask because it is my duty, not to quell the pining in my heart as you may be inlined to believe.
>
> Elyse.
