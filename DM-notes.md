## **Manyshells**

### Anchorheart's Folly

> *Lenna Madizos* was recalled from the Manyshells. Church clerics and paladins were sent in her place. She discovered the Church was requisitioning vast amounts of basilisk venom in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia. *Subira* tracked the venom to Rose Merryn’s Pre-Loved Goods in *Runnelstone*, a CSCA-occupied island close to *Mallia*.

Rose was smuggling the venom on behalf of the Church. She and Subira were captured by *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* during a pirate raid. The pirates destroyed the venom on orders from Queen Vasilissa.

The 6oS must track down the *Wrath of Umberlee* with the help of Elyse. Rumours suggest Anchorheart is looking for the stolen submarine to add to his fleet. Hence, *ABC* is posing as one of Anchorheart's crew. Plundered CSCA vessels can be found in the Wrath's wake.

Anchorheart ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. He offers the Queen gemlock weapons and in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the Manyshells.

- If **Guy** chooses to join Anchorheart, he must hand over the rifle.
  - The Verity will join Anchorheart's fleet and attack the CSCA bank at *Sullivanton*.
- If **Guy** refuses to join Anchorheart, he will threaten to kill *Subira*.
  - The execution fails due to damp powder. The powder monkey, ABC, reveals herself and joins the battle.

### Project Abyss

> *Naal* was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Now Camren has been arrested, Naal accompanies *Vetra* as she steals the submarine and flees to the Manyshells.

The Circle continue construction of the submarine hidden in the *Farwest Archipelago*. Vetra wants to recover the body of Tenebrae (*Arzhang*) from *Mundi Eversor* in the *Vena Trench*. She intends to revive him to prove that Caelum created the Miasma. The submarine may be attacked by triton from *Abyssus* on its journey.

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

> Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

River Chapman may trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane. Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the 6oS must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

> *Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines.

Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees. The crown jewels will be on display, ripe for theft.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
10. Caelum ascends to divinity, leaving Ten to activate the pillars and shield the relief.
