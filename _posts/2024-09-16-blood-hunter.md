# Blood Hunter Order

### Order of the Lantern

The Order of the Lantern is a clandestine organisation of *Blood Hunters* who undergo a ritual that allows them to safely navigate and research the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma). They have strong ties with the [Commission](commission). Given the nature of your tainted blood, your DM may ask for a Constitution saving throw any time you take necrotic damage when invoking a blood curse or crimson rite. On a failed save, your level of ***psychosis*** may increase.

##### **Psychosis Table**

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | The creature inhales Miasma exuded from the environment or an attack and is ***poisoned***                                                        |
| 2     | The creature becomes dizzy and its speed is halved                                                                                                |
| 3     | The creature experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on saving throws                                                               |
| 4     | The creature's skin tone becomes pallid, its eyes turn purple and its hit point maximum is halved                                                 |
| 5     | The creature suffers extreme paranoia and must use its action each round to attack the nearest creature                                           |
| 6     | The creature becomes an ***aberration***. It can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way |

If a psychotic creature suffers another effect that causes psychosis, its current level of psychosis increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of psychosis as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 psychosis has its speed halved and is poisoned.

An effect that removes psychosis reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all psychosis effects ending if a creature's psychosis level is reduced below 1. If a psychotic creature is targeted by an effect that neutralises poison, that effect has a duration of 1 hour. The creature is then poisoned again unless its psychosis level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1, provided that the creature is outside the Miasma and has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1. A ***lesser restoration*** reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1. A ***greater restoration*** reduces a creature's psychosis level by 1d4+1.

##### **Rite of the Dusk**

When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dusk as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of the Dusk, the extra damage dealt by your rite is poison damage. Additionally, while that rite is active on your weapon, you gain the following benefits:

- Your weapon disperses fog in a 20-foot radius. The fog reforms behind you as you move through it.
- Creatures hit with your weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.
- When you hit a poisoned creature with your weapon, roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.

##### **Aberrant Gaze**

Starting at 3rd level, you can see a faint aura around poisoned creatures to a distance of 120 feet. Your sight can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. You can see poisoned creatures normally in non-magical darkness.

##### **Psychotic Rebuke**

Starting at 7th level, when you are damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to enshroud the creature that damaged you with a cloud of poisonous, purple fog. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is blinded for 1 minute and its psychosis level increases by 1. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the blinded condition ends.

##### **Purge Toxins**

Starting at 11th level, as an action, you can forcefully extract the poison from afflicted creatures you touch. Choose one of the following effects:

- A poisoned creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your spellcasting ability modifier. Any poisons afflicting the target are neutralised. If the target has a psychosis level, it is reduced by 1d4+1 and you may roll an additional hemocraft die for each level of psychosis removed when determining the number of hit points regained.

- A poisoned creature you touch takes necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your spellcasting ability modifier. Any poisons afflicting the target are neutralised. If the target has a psychosis level, it is reduced by 1d4+1 and you may roll an additional hemocraft die for each level of psychosis removed when determining the damage taken.

##### **Aberrant Gaze Improvement**

Starting at 15th level, your Aberrant Gaze can now penetrate all barriers and you can see poisoned creatures normally in magical darkness. Also, you have advantage on attack rolls against aberrations. As an action, you can gaze upon a poisoned creature within 120 feet and increase its psychosis level by 2.

##### **Blood Curse of the Miasma**

At 18th level, you gain the Blood Curse of the Miasma for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.

**Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lantern.**

Choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you that is poisoned. It takes 2d6 necrotic damage and poisonous, purple fog spills from its veins in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for 10 minutes or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the curse. Its area is heavily obscured. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 poison damage. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

**Amplify.**

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the fog up to 20 feet. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its psychosis level increases by 1.
