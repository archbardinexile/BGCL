## **Arcane Tradition**

### Lapidurgy

A lapidurge studies and shapes gemstones in great detail in order to achieve certain magical effects. By guiding the weave through an adequately cut gemstone, a lapidurge can refine and even augment their spells. The practice originated in Atada, where sparkling mineral deposits gave rise to the formidable *Diamond Guard*, who use blades of light to protect their queen.

#### **Refract Light**

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you receive a set of four gemstones. Whenever you cast a spell that sheds light, a ***mote*** of that light is captured in a gemstone of your choice. As an action, you can expend a mote to activate one of the following effects:

**Chromatic Ray.** A beam of light streaks toward a creature within 60 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 damage. The gemstone you used determines the attack's damage type, as shown in the table below. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Prismatic Ward.** A protective magical force surrounds you. Until the end of your next turn, the gemstone you used determines the type of damage you have resistance against, as shown in the table below.

##### Gemstones

| Gemstone | Damage type |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Ruby     | Fire        |
| Sapphire | Cold        |
| Emerald  | Necrotic    |
| Diamond  | Radiant     |

#### **Stone Cutter**

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with Jeweller’s Tools and shortswords.
