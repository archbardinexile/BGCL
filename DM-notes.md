## **Manyshells**

The destruction of the venom was ordered by Queen *Vasilissa*, in league with *Anchorheart*. The queen gave him a magical weapon to help him bind an Elder Tempest to his ship, the *Umberlee's Wrath*. It can shroud his fleet in fog.

Anchorheart ordered **Guy** to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. With gemlock weapons, the Mallians can invade the Manyshells and destroy the CSCA. The queen has promised Anchorheart territory.

The *Crosscut Circle* have allied with the *githzechi* to construct the submarine. Anchorheart wants to add the submarine to his fleet and equip it with gemlock weapons.

### The Siege of Farwest

The Crosscut Circle are supported by ***3 githzechi ships***. The submarine has been moved to *Pedn Vounder* using a catamaran. The submarine will be seaworthy on ***Flavum 12th***, allowing *Vetra* to escape underwater.

Traps have been laid at the submarine's previous location. Underwater spikes are ***difficult terrain*** and may ***damage (AC 15)*** or ***restrain (DC 10)*** ships. ***4d4*** piercing damage per spike (1d6).

The Wrath's crew is composed of **Pirates*** with hit points 44–68. *ABC* is aboard the Wrath posing as a powder monkey. She can sabotage its weapons if Anchorheart tries to bombard *Farwest*.

Anchorheart must make an ***intimidation check (DC 15 with pain symbol)*** to successfully interrogate the githzechi. They have not been told the new location of the submarine. Anchorheart may use the githzechi's sending stone.
- ***If no traps are revealed***, Anchorheart will send 2 small ships to pursue the *Lady Firehair* into *Farwest*.
- ***If traps are revealed***, Anchorheart will send ***Yuan-Ti Malison*** and ***Triton Shorestalkers*** to investigate. One of the Shorestalkers carries a scrying orb.
  - ***If Guy is spotted***, Anchorheart will cast sending and torture *Rose* unless Guy reveals the submarine's location.

- *Durzus*' 8 ships will arrive on 11th-12th
- *Elyse*'s airship will arrive 12th-13th
- *Elyse*'s ships will arrive on 16th-17th

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

> Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

Lighting the candles creates a portal to a corridor of mirrors presenting infinite destinations. The Six of Steel may have to fight their duplicates to continue.

- The Arx expedition can be seen trapped in a sandstone maze demiplane.
  - Six of Steel must guide them out while battling mirror mephits.
  - Darkhalijz, the spirit cloak worn by Xander Coppermane, tells how the staff from his collection banishes enemies to the mirror plane. To escape they must find and destroy it.
- Chance can be seen trapped in a giant hourglass on an infinite chequerboard.

River Chapman will trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane. Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the Six of Steel must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

> *Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

> *Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines.

Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

> The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
