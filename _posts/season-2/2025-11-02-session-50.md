**Arti** and **Firien** step forward to defend *Aura* as without warning the Grand Inquisitor summons a unique, magical warhammer. Planting his weapon, *Tristis* explains that the *Fist of Caelum* is also a key. The ground quakes as marked tiles sink below the marble floor, revealing a staircase. **Blythe**'s eyes widen. The *Six of Steel* were about to enter the vault. The party agree to enter, but not before Firien casts death ward on the Exarch. As they descend, **Gomruss** subtly examines Tristis' heavy armour, while **Bantonio** studies the man's attributes. Between them, they find very few weaknesses.

With a wave of his hand, Tristis lights several chandeliers, illuminating the vault. The grand chamber is filled with artefacts, scriptures and tapestries, all sealed behind magical locks. **Guy** surveys the chamber for traps but finds only curious decorations in the ceiling. Perhaps an alarm system of some kind. Tristis unlocks the case containing *Tenebrae*'s diary and passes it to Aura. Swallowing the lump in her throat, she reads *Ten*'s heretical words aloud.

Tenebrae began their life as an artist. Receiving visions of a blight upon the land, Tenebrae felt compelled to paint a swirling dark purple void surrounding the region of Profundus. Having dwelt on the meaning of their ominous painting, Tenebrae was sought out by *Chauntea*, the deity of life and agriculture. She encouraged Tenebrae to travel the land and construct stone pillars that might retain the true history of events to come. These pillars would bear the blessings of Chauntea, *Lathander* and *Bahamut* so that together they might shield Profundus from the coming blight.

Tenebrae travelled the region for six years, beseeching those in power to prepare for the coming blight. Very few heeded their word. In that time, they and their followers managed to construct 24 pillars. However, upon hearing that many of the pillars had been vandalised by terror-stricken cynics, Tenebrae began to doubt their ability to complete the task entrusted to them. Fleeing from *Church of Lathander*, *Lao Tan*, until recently an aid to *Caelum Sol Orbis*, sought out Tenebrae in order to tell the tale of the Grand Paladin's treachery.

Lao Tan implored Tenebrae to focus their efforts not on preparing for the inevitable, but on discovering a way to prevent it. She spoke of a cabal of powerful fiends that dwelt in the region of Discidium, who may be able to help. Having challenged and rediscovered their resolve, Tenebrae travelled to Discidium to seek out the *League of Archfiends*. Their number was said to include a powerful rakshasa sorcerer, an alu-fiend seductress, a cambion warmonger, and a durzagon artificer.

The fiends did not believe Tenebrae's tale until the shape-shifting alu-fiend returned with proof of Caelum's treachery. With the Archfiends' influence, Tenebrae's allies soon multiplied and collection began of the graphite required to construct the enormous diamond that would become the heart of Mundi Eversor; a great colossus that could match the powers of Caelum Sol Orbis, the aasimar who was to bring forth the Miasma in his bid for ascension.
