### Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the ***Player's Handbook*** when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a monk. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

##### **Absorb Ki (Optional)**

Starting at 3rd level, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from its attack roll. If the creature misses, you gain ki points equal to the number you rolled.

# Monastic Traditions

### Way of the Spirit Temple

The Spirit Temple monks seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue [earthmotes](exploration#earthmotes) and send them back into the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma). They have an agreement with the [Church](church-of-caelum) that enables them to serve alongside expeditions and help prevent natural disasters.

##### **Spirit Guardian**

At 3rd level, you adopt a spirit guardian and gain its feature. You must train with masters of the Spirit Temple or study the behaviour of an appropriate animal in the wild. The animal you study may be similar to those listed here or be more appropriate for your homeland. For example, you may choose to study a leopard or lion in place of a tiger. You can adopt an additional spirit guardian of your choice at 6th, 11th and 17th level. Whenever you adopt a new spirit guardian, you can choose to dismiss one spirit guardian and replace it with a different spirit guardian available to you at that level.

Some spirit guardians allow you to cast spells. Casting a spell requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as ***burning hands*** does. The spell's level increases by one for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the table below.

| Monk Level | Spirit Guardians | Max Ki for a spell |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 3          | 1                | 2                  |

##### **Spirit Guardians**

**Bear.** While your ki points are at their maximum, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

**Crane (6th Level Required).** ***Deflect missiles*** now affects ranged spell attacks. If you have the ***mantis*** spirit guardian, you can also deflect ranged spell attacks targeting allies within 5 feet of you.

**Deer.** When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed, leaving behind an illusory duplicate of yourself. The duplicate's AC is equal to your own and it has 1 hit point. The creature must attack the duplicate unless it makes a successful Wisdom saving throw. The duplicate is destroyed at the start of your next turn.

**Eagle (11th Level Required).** You can spend 4 ki points to cast ***fly***.

**Elephant.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. In addition, choose one 1st-level spell to learn from the druid spell list, it costs 2 ki points to cast at its lowest level. If it is listed as a ritual, you can cast it as a ritual.

**Lizard (6th Level Required).** You can spend 3 ki points to cast ***invisibility***.

**Mantis.** ***Deflect missiles*** now affects ranged weapon attacks targeting allies within 5 feet of you.

**Monkey (11th Level Required).** You can spend 4 ki points to create 2 spectral floating hands at a point you choose within 30 feet. The hands last for 1 minute or until you dismiss them as an action. The hands must stay together and they vanish if they are ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. The hands' ability scores, hit point maximum and AC equal your own. You can move the hands up to 30 feet each time you use them.

You can use your action to control the hands. You can use the hands to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can use your bonus action to make 2 unarmed strikes with the hands, using your martial arts die in place of the normal damage and adding any modifiers you would if you had used ***flurry of blows***.

**Snake (17th Level Required).** You can spend 5 ki points to cast ***freedom of movement***.

**Tiger.** When you use ***flurry of blows***, add your wisdom modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. You can choose whether flurry of blows deals bludgeoning damage or slashing damage.

**Turtle.** You can spend 2 ki points to cast ***shield***.

**Wolf (17th Level Required).** Whenever an ally within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, they can roll 1d4 times the number of allies within 30 feet of you and add the total to the attack roll or saving throw.
