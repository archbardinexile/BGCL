title: Session 10 New Blood
---

**Gomruss** explains to **Guy** his role in the tournament and so the pirate—still slightly hungover—wanders around *Crowswood Place* in search of training. He discovers the locked door to *Hadley*'s workshop and picks the lock, unnoticed. Inside, Guy tries his hand at unlocking the drawer beneath a bubbling glass still. The drawer clicks, revealing several iterations of Arti's technical drawings. Hearing footsteps, Guy quickly replaces the drawings and locks the drawer. He fails to lock the door behind him as *Corvus* nods to him in passing.

Outside, **Bantonio** solicits *Tupak* for use of a glider so that he might train for the tournament. Spotting **Blythe**, Bantonio suggests the half-elf use his glider as more challenging target practice. Diving from the tower, Bantonio builds enough speed to touch two targets but misses the last as he has to correct his balance. Blythe is able to hit Bantonio's glider twice. In the library, while Gomruss further revises riddles, Arti trains for the strength challenge by lifting *Subira* so she can return some books to the higher shelves.

***The party have advantage on 3 ability checks of their choice during the tournament.***

### Sun District

The rain eases as the party take an hour to walk to the *Sun District* where they find rival adventuring teams training on the playing field outside the *Bounty Hunters Lodge*. Gomruss spies the wizard *Tabitha* and her team, *The Feywild Ones*; *Elaina Thistlewind*, the elf rogue who slapped Gomruss the night before; *Cylaros*, a Szarkai ranger; and *Cade Beckonhand*, son of *Kurt* the former lighthouse keeper. Spying Cade, Blythe prepares a new disguise.

The party meet *Vigor*, the statuesque tiefling hosting the tournament, and each pay the entry fee of ***20 gold***. Vigor explains the rules of the tournament, then asks for the party's team name.

> "Guy Brush and the... Brushlings!"
>
> "I don't want to be a Brushling."
>
> *Guy's suggestion is rejected by Blythe.*

After some debate, the party introduce themselves as *The Six of Steel*.
