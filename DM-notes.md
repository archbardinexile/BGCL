## **Caelum's Landing**

### Homecoming

While the 6oS were in the Miasma...

- *Tristis* successfully read **Blythe**'s thoughts leading to the arrest of *Camren*.
- The Inquisition attacked the *Dawnroot Druids* to retrieve the letter, then altered their memories.
- The Inquisition ceased construction of *Loronath*'s submarine
  - *Vetra Bery* stole the submarine and fled to the Manyshells.
- *Subira* tracked the basilisk venom to *Runnelstone* a CSCA-occupied island close to Mallia.
  - The Crows have not heard from her in 7 days.
- The petrified dinosaur rider from *Primal Antiqua*, 744 PO, *Miyoko*, joined the *Commission*.
- *Aura* declared monopolies on essential goods (including resonite) illegal.
  - The *Garnetgrinder Clan* sold their Resonant Mine shares to other guilds including Micantrum.
  - *Cade* used his father's money to buy the mine on *Tenebrae's Refuge*.
- *Roshia* evaded the Inquisition and returned to *Arx* having heard of an expedition gone missing.

### Race for the Truth

- Naal, while grappling Blythe, can move 30 feet per turn (6 seconds)
- Firien and Gomruss can move 60 feet per turn (6 seconds) **gaining 30 feet per turn**
- Naal is 5 turns/150 feet/30 seconds ahead of Firien and Gomruss
- Naal is 22 turns/650 feet/2 mins 12 seconds ahead of Arti, Bantonio and Guy

- Naal cannot dash the same turn as glyph of warding is cast (15 feet that turn)
- Blythe may try to escape Naal (15 feet that turn)
- Naal will reach a hidden teleportation circle in 4 turns
  - He must spend 1 turn setting explosives before teleporting

The teleportation circle leads to a cave where the *Crosscut Circle* are hiding. They will deactivate their circle if the hidden circle is not destroyed.

Firien and Gomruss will be taken prisoner. Naal will tell them the story of the expedition from Tamlo and ask the Six of Steel to help them.

During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion.

A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest.

### The Inquisition

The Inquisitors will escort the 6oS to the *Oratory* for debriefing. If accused, *Tristis* will reveal how an expedition from *Tamlo* in 972 PO returned from the Miasma with Tenebrae's diary. Tristis' order intervened, murdering the psychotic expedition members and sealing the blasphemous artefact in the vault beneath the Oratory. *Ardeat Sol Orbis* then founded the Inquisition, naming Tristis *Grand Inquisitor*.

The diary reveals that ten pillars were constructed by *Ten*, *Lathander*, *Chauntea* and *Bahamut* to protect the Relief from the Miasma. Each pillar holds a memory of Ten. Mundi Eversor was created to prevent Caelum completing a ritual to exorcise his evil and ascend to godhood. According to the diary, the Miasma is Caelum's evil expelled during his failed ritual.

Tristis doesn't know that Ten, as Eversor, failed to absorb Caelum's evil when the diamond heart was struck. Half of Ten's soul now resides in the Miasma. If all ten pillars are activated, Ten can disperse the Miasma entirely.

Tristis will allow the 6oS to go free if they agree to have their memories altered. If the 6oS convince Aura to reveal the truth, Tristis will attempt a coup and attack Aura. Aura must hold Tristis while the 6oS flee. **Tristis is a Level 20 Psi Warrior. Aura is a Level 20 Redemption Paladin.**

- If fleeing through the city, the 6oS will be chased by Inquisitors.
  - Clerics were reassigned to the Manyshells to minimise resistance against the coup.
- If fleeing on the Verity, Church gliders will attempt to stop them.
- If fleeing via gate, a corridor of mirrors shall present infinite destinations.

## **Manyshells**

### Anchorheart's Folly

*Lenna Madizos* was recalled from the Manyshells. Church clerics and paladins were sent in her place. She discovered the Church was requisitioning vast amounts of basilisk venom in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia. *Subira* tracked the venom to *Runnelstone*, a CSCA-occupied island close to *Mallia*, and was captured by *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* during a pirate raid.

The 6oS must track down the *Wrath of Umberlee*. Rumours suggest Anchorheart is looking for the stolen submarine to add to his fleet. Hence, *ABC* is posing as one of Anchorheart's crew. Plundered CSCA vessels can be found in the Wrath's wake.

Anchorheart ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. He offers the Queen gemlock weapons and in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the Manyshells.

- If **Guy** chooses to join Anchorheart, he must hand over the rifle.
  - The Verity will join Anchorheart's fleet and attack the CSCA bank at *Sullivanton*.
- If **Guy** refuses to join Anchorheart, he will threaten to kill *Subira*.
  - The execution fails due to damp powder. The powder monkey, ABC, reveals herself and joins the battle.

### Project Abyss

*Naal* was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Now Camren has been arrested, Naal accompanies *Vetra* as she steals the submarine and flees to the Manyshells.

The Circle continue construction of the submarine hidden in the *Farwest Archipelago*. Vetra wants to recover the body of Tenebrae (*Arzhang*) from *Mundi Eversor* in the *Vena Trench*. She intends to revive him to prove that Caelum created the Miasma. The submarine may be attacked by triton from *Abyssus* on its journey.

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape. River Chapman may trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane.

Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the 6oS must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

*Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines. Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees. The crown jewels will be on display, ripe for theft.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

---

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

*Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
10. Caelum ascends to divinity, leaving Ten to activate the pillars and shield the relief.
