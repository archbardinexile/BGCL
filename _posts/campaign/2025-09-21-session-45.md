title: Session 45 The Earth of Me—Part 1
---

**Guy** examines the clouds through his spyglass. Though familiar with storms of this size at sea, he suspects magic may be perpetuating the swirling vortex. Static tickles **Arti**'s metal components. He had no doubt the pillar was at the centre of the storm. **Firien** suggests they gain altitude then have the *Verity* descend into the eye of the storm, while *Tuperk* recommends they continue on his balloon. Guy strokes his chin and asks *Eureka* if it would be possible to create a lightning rod. The artificer is delighted by the captain's ingenuity and sets to work immediately.

Using the metal they salvaged from the spelljammer, the crew construct a rudimentary lightning rod connecting the mast to the keel. Guy orders a descent to sea level, safely grounding the Verity as it enters the storm. Having weathered several lightning strikes, they soon arrive at the sunken peak of an inverted mountain. Preferring to keep the Verity grounded, the *Six of Steel* decide to ascend in Tuperk's balloon. *Glimback* entrusts *Spiro* with Arti's heart and joins the party. The Grand Paladin squeezes Firien's shoulder in acknowledgement. Arti tethers himself to the balloon and begins climbing the mountain.

### Ten's pillar

Arti pulls the balloon in to land. He and Firien recognise the landscape from their visions, though the grass is now ashen grey. While the swirling storm above threatens to strike at any moment, its centre marks their waypoint. By the light of their lanterns, the pillar soon comes into view. However, Arti's excitement is curtailed by the unwelcome figure standing behind it. *Kalyptos* emerges folding a pair of draconic wings behind him. When questioned, he reveals the Inquisition amulet around his neck.

> "You! You bastard! You left my son to die!"
>
> "My orders were to prevent you from reaching the pillar at any cost."
>
> "Then the Inquisition already knew about the pillar. Do you even know what it does?"
>
> *Glimback to Kalyptos. Firien interrogates Kalyptos.*

Firien recounts the events of their vision, explaining how activating the pillar will disperse the Miasma. Invoking *Bahamut*'s name only angers the Inquisitor and he turns to **Bantonio** for help. Firien laughs cynically—their friend would never betray them. Bantonio stands resolute and attempts to deceive Kalyptos, claiming that Caelum and Bahamut are aligned. Though momentarily pensive, the Inquisitor sees through the ruse. He holds up a twenty-sided die. Arti's heart skips a beat. Eyes wide, **Gomruss** slyly takes the die from his pocket. Firien's fingers sparkle with electricity.

> "I don't want to kill you, Kalyptos. You don't deserve Bahamut's mercy. But I will deliver his justice if I must."
>
> "You misunderstand, Firien. I believe in the Inquisition. If you are Bahamut's justice then I am Caelum's wrath. Let us see which prevails."
>
> *Firien to Kalyptos in draconic.*

Kalyptos casts his die, illuminating the battlefield, and from it emerges the psychotic, five-headed chimera from Arti's nightmares. Without hesitation, Firien calls upon the perpetual storm above and strikes the chimera with a supercharged bolt of lightning! In retaliation, it charges forward. Arti grabs Glimback and the pair dive out of the way. While Guy too avoids the attack, the others are trampled. Satisfied, the chimera raises its dragon head only to have it blown off! The whip crack of Guy's rifle rings out as the chimera's wound oozes gelatinous Miasma.

Clambering to his feet, Gomruss casts his die, summoning his basilisk! Aghast, Kalyptos immediately shields his eyes.
