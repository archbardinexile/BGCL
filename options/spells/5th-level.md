- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (magnetised iron worth at least 1 sp)

Make a ranged spell attack against a Medium or smaller creature within range. If the target is a construct or wearing metal armour, you have advantage on the attack roll. A beam of crackling energy streaks toward the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage and is pushed 5 feet + a number of feet equal to 5 × your spellcasting ability modifier in a direction you choose.

*5th-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an iron ball that weighs at least 1 lb.)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Gravity intensifies around a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +5 bonus to AC for the duration.

If it fails the check, its speed is halved.
