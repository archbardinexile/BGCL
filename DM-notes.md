## **Manyshells**

### Anchorheart's Folly

> *Lenna Madizos* was recalled from the Manyshells. Church clerics and paladins were sent in her place. She discovered the Church was requisitioning vast amounts of basilisk venom in preparation for a confrontation with Mallia. *Subira* tracked the venom to Rose Merryn’s Pre-Loved Goods in *Runnelstone*, a CSCA-occupied island close to *Mallia*.

> *Elyse* asked *Rose* to smuggle the basilisk venom to discover the CSCA's plans. Rose and *Subira* were captured by *Bhaldrom Anchorheart* when his fleet attacked Runnelstone. Rose's shop and the venom were destroyed.

The destruction of the venom was ordered by Queen *Vasilissa*, in league with Anchorheart.

Anchorheart has bound a powerful water elemental to his ship, the *Umberlee's Wrath*. It shrouded his fleet in fog during the attack. To track the elemental, the 6oS have enlisted the help of *Daniel*, a meteorologist and member of the *Society of Brilliance*. They must drop magical buoys into the sea at regular intervals so Daniel can record the water temperature. Once complete, Daniel can track the water elemental.

Use **At Sea** encounter tables
- Week-old plundered CSCA ships show signs of Umberlant attack
- Pirate ship flies Umberlant flag as deterrent when smuggling *joose* though Anchorheart's territory
  - The smell of joose is impure—unlike that of the business card
  - Fairy dust is used to make *joose*—it is ethically sourced from the *Sylvan Kingdoms* or stolen from captured fey
- A whale singing Lydia's song can lead the 6oS to another pillar underwater
- NPC clinging to rubble is *Elisa Santiago*, **Bantonio**'s niece, who took a bard job aboard a CSCA ship

*Julian*'s contacts report no strange activity at trade ports. However, ships have been reported going to *Os Terrae* from *Farwest Archipelago*. The Crosscut Circle have enlisted Githzechi engineers and used materials from *Shka'keth*.

*ABC* is aboard the *Wavemother's Fortune* and intends to rendezvous with Umberlee's Wrath. She will pose as the powder monkey of Anchorheart's crew.

The Wrath of Umberlee can be found sailing for the *Farwest Archipelago* to investigate ships from Os Terrae.
- If found at sea, the 6oS may choose to tail or attack. Anchorheart may recognise the Marley and threaten Elyse.
- If successfully tailed or found at the Archipelago, Anchorheart prepares a raid on the *Crosscut Circle* base.

Anchorheart ordered Guy to retrieve the triple-barrelled gemlock rifle from Caelum's Landing, having made a deal with Queen *Vasilissa*. He offers the Queen gemlock weapons, in exchange the Mallians force the CSCA out of the Manyshells.

- If **Guy** chooses to join Anchorheart, he must hand over the rifle.
  - The 6oS will join Anchorheart's fleet and attack the CSCA bank at *Sullivanwick*.
  - The 6oS will help Anchorheart track down the submarine.
- If **Guy** refuses to join Anchorheart, he will threaten to kill *Subira*.
  - The execution fails due to damp powder. The powder monkey, ABC, reveals herself and joins the battle.

### Project Abyss

> *Naal* was picked by the Grand Inquisitor to join the *Crosscut Circle* undercover due to his closeness with *Camren de Villeneuve*. The Grand Herald was told to announce Naal's dismissal but refused. Now Camren has been arrested, Naal accompanies *Vetra* as she steals the submarine and flees to the Manyshells.

The Circle continue construction of the submarine hidden in the *Farwest Archipelago*. Vetra wants to recover the body of Tenebrae (*Arzhang*) from *Mundi Eversor* in the *Vena Trench*. She intends to revive him to prove that Caelum created the Miasma. The submarine may be attacked by triton from *Abyssus* on its journey.

The 6oS cannot reveal that the body inside Eversor is not Tenebrae, lest they break their oath.

The Circle will defend their base long enough to force Anchorheart into retreat.

## **Plane of Mirrors**

### Confront River Chapman

> Tymora's emissary, *Chance*, has been trapped in a mirror by *River Chapman*, who is using her luck to influence his business and income. Chance recruits Gomruss to help her escape.

Lighting the candles creates a portal to a corridor of mirrors presenting infinite destinations. The 6oS may have to fight their duplicates to continue.

- The Arx expedition can be seen trapped in a sandstone maze demiplane.
  - 6oS must guide them out while battling mirror mephits.
  - Darkhalijz, the spirit cloak worn by Xander Coppermane, tells how the staff from his collection banishes enemies to the mirror plane. To escape they must find and destroy it.
- Chance can be seen trapped in a giant hourglass on an infinite chequerboard.

River Chapman will trap the party in his game room, an infinite chequerboard demiplane. Chance is trapped in a giant hourglass. To escape, the 6oS must defeat dark and light monsters and shatter the hourglass before time runs out. Releasing Chance breaks River Chapman's contract with *Malaika*, the alu-fiend who granted him the power to trap Chance.

## **Arx**

### Unearth the Tomb

> *Gurdeep Darshan*, the representative from the *Arx Institute of Archaeology* offered work clearing out a buried tomb in *Os Terrae*. Darshan's first expedition became lost in the plane of mirrors, the party must rescue them. The tomb contains undead. The throne room houses a staff that can open portals to the plane of mirrors.

The party may discover a leopard-skin cloak inhabited by the spirit of a tabaxi thief king, *Darkhalijz*, who made a deal for immortality with *Abishek*. Trapped beneath a mountain of his own gold, his resurrections became a never-ending cycle, earning him a half-life as a cloak.

## **Micantrum**

### Investigate the Mining Dispute

> *Snicker Nickelfoot* saw a miner fall to his death in the Resonant Mines, triggering the unionisation of the miners. The Ministry could not confirm the existence of the fallen miner and prevented the implementation of better health and safety in the mines.

Spiro encouraged his sister to intervene. Aura instructed the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell shares of the Resonant Mines and outlawed monopolies on essential goods like resonite.

The *Think Tank*, led by *Zdenek*, in league with the *Micantrum Mining Consortium*, modified Snicker's memory to persuade the Church to purchase resonite from MMC instead of GC. Zdenek, Malaika and Abishek are pulling strings across the Relief to accrue enough resources to create their own demiplane.

## **Atada and Atado**

### The Diamond Ball

> The Queen of Diamante is hosting a ball following successful negotiations with the Emmeraude Republic. Magical trees were encroaching on Diamante territory. Emmeraude called for the cessation of deforestation. The Feywild Ones sought out *Lothran* in the Sylvan Kingdoms and found a way to quell the trees.

An assassination attempt on the queen's life will seemingly reveal the Emmeraude Republic are to blame. However, this is an excuse for *Baldassare Leonardi*, the head of the Diamond Guard to declare martial law. *Tiamo Trouve* was exiled when he lost a duel to Baldassare. Tiamo challenged his warmongering and punitive leadership.

## **Fio**

### Find the Pillars

Whoever touches the pillar is granted a vision (1d10). Each pillar holds one of Ten's memories:

1. Ten paints a picture of the Miasma. Bahamut, Chauntea and Lathander beseech them to make the pillars.
2. Ten and their followers are attacked by vandals who want to destroy the pillars.
3. Ten is sought out by *Lao Tan*, a Lathander cleric who warns of *Caelum*'s treachery.
4. Ten and Lao Tan seek the *League of Archfiends* to help construct *Mundi Eversor*.
5. *Malaika* returns with proof of Caelum's treachery.
6. Ten watches the evacuation of Discidium and laments that Lao Tan had to return to Anfang.
7. **FOUND** Ten grants half his soul to Eversor's diamond heart, activating the colossus.
8. Caelum's ritual is interrupted when Mundi Eversor erupts from beneath Discidium.
9. Ten tries to absorb the Miasma pouring from Caelum when he strikes the heart, releasing the Miasma.
10. Caelum ascends to divinity, leaving Ten to activate the pillars and shield the relief.
