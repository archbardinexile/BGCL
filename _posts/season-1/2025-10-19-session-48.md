### The Verity

The Clerics aboard the *Verity* are in high demand as the crew take turns sending messages to their loved ones. *Lemon*, *Jaytrix*'s goldfinch companion, returns carrying a small scroll which the monk promptly hands to Captain Brush. The message is from *Aura*, explaining how she intends to announce a celebration honouring the *Six of Steel* to prevent Inquisition interference. In reply, **Firien** estimates that after visiting *Madanau*, they will arrive at *Crowswood Place* the afternoon of the 22nd.

Upon **Guy**'s request, Firien sends a message to *Agnes*, the Captain's former nanny. ABC sends her congratulations and informs Firien that she is on the trail of *Loronath*'s stolen submarine. **Arti** requests they contact *Subira* to make sure she's safe. To everyone's relief, Subira replies in whispered tones. She has tracked the basilisk venom to *Runnelstone* in the *Manyshells*. Guy strokes his chin. The island is a minor trade port operated by the *CSCA*.

### Madanau

The crew disembark to thunderous applause. The *Feywild Ones* push through the crowd to meet the Six of Steel at the dock. *Tabitha* launches herself at **Gomruss** before his boots even touch the sand. He topples over and is peppered with proud kisses. *Elaina* lifts her embarrassing companion onto her feet before offering her own congratulations. **Blythe** greets *Cylaros* and returns his gift. The bracer bears a slash from the chimera's claw. Cylaros blushes when Blythe explains how it saved her life.

*Cade* insists on shaking everyone's hand as he recounts how he used his father's inheritance to purchase the mine they found on *Tenebrae's Refuge*. When *Aura* settled the miners' dispute by forcing the *Garnetgrinder Clan* to sell their shares of the *Resonant Mines*, Cade's wealth skyrocketed.

> "And it's all thanks to you guys! I've gotta give you some kind of reward... name anything!"
>
> "How about a hug?"
>
> Cade to Arti.

*Buddleja* flutters around Arti, curious about their new appearance, before introducing the newest member of the Feywild Ones; *Lothran*, the handsome half-elf who helped them dissuade *Émeraude*'s living forests from encroaching on *Diamante*'s territory. Lothran's eyes grow wide when Arti mentions the telomere seeds, making Firien suspicious. Gomruss spies a pink tint to the warlock's pierced extremities but cannot determine who their patron might be.

Firien's family invite the Six of Steel to enjoy a moment of respite at the *Sugartooth Bakery*. There, *Spiro* and *Clara* reunite with their sibling, *Sana*. Firien rises to intimidate a persistent reporter and spots several suspicious patrons watching their friends—undercover inquisitors perhaps? Guy picks up a newspaper and smirks at the CSCA's diminishing share value. The cover reads 'World looks to new horizon!'

> "While this new frontier presents new opportunities for exploration and eventually expansion, we must not ignore its perils. We must not let slip our morals, for they are what define us in this ever-changing world."
>
> A quote from Aura's statement in the newspaper.
