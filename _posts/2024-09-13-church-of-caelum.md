title: The Church of Caelum (Faction)
---

The Church of Caelum is the most prominent nation in the [Relief](setting-started#the-relief). Ruled by the *Exarch*, [Aura Sol Orbis](#aura-sol-orbis), its territories stretch as far as the [Miasma](getting-started#the-miasma). Its capital, Caelum's Landing, is the largest and most populous city in the Relief, with much of the region's trade passing through its markets. Since the creation of the *Fundus Constitution* in [416 PO](timeline#416-po), governance of the nation has been shared with the [Ministry](ministry), while the [Inland Guard](ministry#inland-guard) police the capital. This makes the nation a *constitutional theocracy*. The Church has remained the most influential and widespread religion in [Fio](getting-started#a-world-obscured) for 1,000 years. It seeks to establish order by expanding its influence and assisting in the development of newfound earthmotes. Though tolerant of other religions, the Church's ubiquity often seems to overwhelm other nascent cultures and religions.

### Roles

- **Exarch** is the title given to the head of the Church of Caelum. The Exarch establishes the laws of the nation as proposed by the *Chairman* of the Ministry. The current Exarch is Aura Sol Orbis. She resides in the *Oratory* on [Caelum's Landing](profundus#caelums-landing).

- **Prefects** are governors of territories belonging to or allied with the Church. This role traditionally goes to members of the Sol Orbis family or high ranking members of the Church.

- **Chaplains** serve as the head of a parish within a Church territory. They usually oversee and reside within a chapel central to the parish. Their duties include delivering sermons and performing marriages.

- **Inquisitors** are tasked with the abolishment of cults and misinformation contrary to the Church's doctrine. They serve as the Church's intelligence agents.

- **Clerics** are the divine warriors and scholars of the Church, often gifted with divine magic of the light and tempest domains.

- **Deans** are the Church's teachers and archivists. Their duties include transcribing holy texts, maintaining sacred artefacts and teaching hopeful acolytes.

- **Acolytes** are educated at the Oratory to properly harness their divine abilities. While most acolytes worship Caelum, education is available for upstarts of other religions.

- **Heralds** are the Church's sacred groundskeepers. Their duties include tending to the Oratory's graveyards and gardens among other sacred sites. They also perform funeral rites.

### Notable Members

##### **Aura Sol Orbis**

- **Race:** Aasimar, Female
- **Born:** [964 PO](timeline#964-po), Caelum's Landing
- **Aliases:** Exarch, Sun of the World, Prefect of Caelum's Landing

Aura Sol Orbis was born on the 14th day of Viridis in the Oratory on Caelum's Landing. As the first of *Ardeat Sol Orbis*' four children, much of her upbringing was focused on preparing her for the day she would inevitably take over as Exarch. Though she shared a close relationship with her father, her politics would grow apart from his as she watched him champion the Church's expansionist practices and perpetuate the *Medusae Wars* until [983 PO](timeline#983-po).

Aura has warm-tinted brown skin and sky-blue eyes much like her father, and sports a long afro gathered into a high ponytail. She and her siblings bare the silver Sol Orbis halo on their foreheads. Those who are granted audience with Aura see her as a kind and understanding soul, while those closest to her know her to be solemn and somewhat lonesome.

Following the natural death of her father, Aura was heralded as the new Exarch in a grand coronation on the 11th day of Flavum, [986 PO](timeline#986-po). Accepting her crown, Aura took her chosen oath of redemption as a paladin of the Church, swearing to right the wrongs of the Medusae Wars and help those affected reintegrate into society. She would go on to declare her brother, [Spiro](#spiro-sol-orbis), Grand Paladin and Prefect of Ingenium, her sibling, [Sana](#sana-sol-orbis), Prefect of [Madanau](profundus#madanau) and her sister [Clara](#clara-sol-orbis), Prefect of [Tenebrae's Refuge](profundus#tenebraes-refuge).
