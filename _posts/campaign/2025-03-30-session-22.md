title: Session 22 Secrets on Ingenium
---

*Eureka* informs the *Six of Steel* that lockdown will end in an hour. At which point, **Blythe**'s suspects will be free to go. **Guy** starts a timer on his pocket watch. Sensing apathy from the elderly receptionist, Blythe first decides to question *Parnella Youngbloom*. **Firien** joins her, acting as bad cop. Dismissive of the dragonborn's attempts to intimidate, Parnella refuses to hand over the employees' personal files as it would be a breech of privacy. However, she does reveal that it's *Fulbert Guzzark*'s job to enter commands at the warforged terminals. She claims the young dwarf was distracted ogling *Jehane*, the senior smith. Blythe jots this down, but remains suspicious of the receptionist's impressive typing speed. Perhaps she could have entered the commands?

**Bantonio** brings a tray of drinks into reception. He approaches *Norhice Nolti* who rocks back and forth as Fulbert rubs her back. The anxious halfling claims she and *Droop* were working on the warforged just before they attacked. Bantonio does not doubt her sincerity. He tips her chin and offers his cloak to keep her warm. *Alfred Bug*, a junior smith, confides in Bantonio. He claims a friend in the Ministry spoke of plans to replace the resonite miners with warforged workers!

Blythe and Firien call Fulbert for interrogation. The young dwarf claims he works for *Ivrinn Goldmask*, the lead command writer. When his focus on the job is called into question, Fulbert seems uneasy. He admits to having a crush on Jehane. Blythe taps her chin. Could the fire genasi have distracted him on purpose? Bantonio subtly questions Jehane about Fulbert's behaviour. Rolling her eyes, she claims she knows how to handle creeps.

**Gomruss** and **Arti** take the elevator to the second floor to investigate Ivrinn's office. Gomruss retches when he discovers Fulbert's desk is decorated with pictures of Jehane. Arti notices Ivrinn's terminal has some kind of adapter attached. Gomruss theorises the device could be used to hide the identity of the command writer. Upon connecting to the terminal, Arti discovers the malicious command, but the writer's identity is indeed hidden. Furthermore, the commands sent to the fire-resistant warforged were delayed until they arrived on floor five. New evidence in hand, the pair head back upstairs.

Guy checks his watch. Five minutes left. He guards the door, hand cannon at the ready.
