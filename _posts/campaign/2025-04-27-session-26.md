### Project Abyss Shipyard

The *Six of Steel* find *Agnes* in the queue to *Project Abyss*. While she intends to enter under the guise of a Nemo Systems employee, **Bantonio** reveals he has secured an invite from the project's lead designer. *Loronath* beckons the party inside, allowing **Blythe** just enough time to don her disguise. In the foyer, several groups of investors engage in small talk over complimentary sandwiches. One investor, a human with a long, wiry beard, stands out to Blythe. **Guy** spies the telltale scars of a sailor on the man's hands, not to mention his pungent salty odour. While Loronath addresses the crowd, Blythe approaches the scraggly investor.

> "I know why you're here."
>
> *Blythe agitates the investor.*

The investor's name tag reads *Wesley Pricklebeard*. Blythe doubts the man is truly a representative of the Oghma Archiveâ€”he was obviously a pirate. Loronath thanks each of the investors and applauds *Vetra Bery* of the Verbatim Foundation for stepping in to save the project when further funding was required. Blythe's ears prick up and she glances again at the letter to *Camren*, signed V. Loronath guides the investors into the factory. Guy's eyes glow as he examines the sophisticated vessel. The submarine's upper half is still under construction, yet it is already the size of six houses.

Loronath invites the investors to enter the submarine, but cautions them not to stray beyond the barrier. Speaking with a disgruntled Loronath, **Gomruss** learns that the CSCA, the primary stakeholders, have requested the project be expanded for military use; hence the need for further funding. Blythe examines a map that shows the proposed route of the submarine's first expedition. The submarine is intended to chart the depths of the *Vena Trench*, where the remains of *Mundi Eversor* erupt from the *Altum Sea*.

Blythe quickly realises that Pricklebeard has disappeared. Raring to investigate, she advises **Firien** who agrees to tip off Loronath after Blythe has had ample opportunity to snoop. Blythe envelops Guy and Bantonio in a pass without trace spell, allowing them to enter the staffrooms undetected. The trio discovers Vetra's office and Guy successfully picks the lock. Open on Vetra's desk, several documents present candidates for the submarine crew. Many have been dismissed by Vetra in favour of her own candidates. Furthermore, it appears Vetra joined Project Abyss less than one month ago.

Exiting Vetra's office, Blythe is keen to practise her lock picking skills and snaps Guy's favourite feather. Their fussing draws the attention of a janitor, who kindly locks the door with a spare set of keys. He must have thought they were staff members. Guy spies bootprints muddying the janitor's work. The trio follows the prints to the design team's office where Pricklebeard rifles through a mess of blueprints. When Blythe announces herself, Pricklebeard spins around. A small pistol snaps into his hand!
