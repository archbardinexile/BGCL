## **Arcane Tradition**

### Lapidurgy

A lapidurge studies and shapes gemstones in great detail in order to achieve magical effects. The practice originated in Atada, where sparkling mineral deposits gave rise to the formidable *Diamond Guard*, who use gemstones to conjure radiant staves in defence of their queen.

#### **Gem Magic**

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you receive a set of four gemstones. You also gain proficiency with ***jeweller’s tools*** which you can use to study and modify the appearance of your gemstones. The gemstones orbit your head during combat.

Whenever you cast a spell that sheds light, a gemstone of your choice is illuminated. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ***light points*** which you can spend to cast Gem Magic. Your light points can't exceed the number of gemstones you have.

When you cast Gem Magic, you may be required to choose a damage type. The damage types shown in the table below are available to you provided you have the corresponding gemstone and it is illuminated. When you choose a damage type, the corresponding gemstone dims.

##### Gemstones

| Gemstone           | Damage Type       | Components |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Diamond            | Radiant           |            |
| Ruby/Sapphire      | Fire/Cold         | Corundum   |
| Emerald/Aquamarine | Force/Psychic     | Beryl      |
| Citrine/Amethyst   | Lightning/Thunder | Quartz     |

##### Gem Magic Spells

**Chromatic Ray.** As a bonus action, spend 1 light point and choose a damage type. A beam of coloured light streaks toward a creature within 60 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 damage of the chosen type. The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Refract Light.** As a reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet casting a spell, spend 2 light points. Make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature is blinded until the end of your next turn. If the spell requires sight, it fails and has no effect.

**Luminous Weapon (6th level required).** As an action, spend 4 light points and choose a damage type. A non-magical weapon within 5 feet becomes a magic weapon. For 1 hour, the wielder can use their spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls of attacks using that weapon and the weapon deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits. The extra damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 9th level (2d4) and 13th level (3d4).

#### **Dancing Gems**

Starting at 2nd level, you learn the ***dancing lights*** cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You can dismiss dancing lights as part of the same action you use to cast it. When you do, you gain 4 light points.

#### **Prismatic Armour**

Starting at 6th level, you can adorn your clothing with luminous armour plating. As an action, choose a damage type. For 8 hours, your base AC becomes 13 + your spellcasting modifier and you have resistance against the chosen damage type. The spell ends if you don armour or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

#### **Stonecutter**

Starting at 10th level, you learn how to transmute gemstones into their mineral counterparts, unlocking their damage types. You can transmute up to three gemstones when you finish a long rest, provided you have the material components. Diamond does not have a mineral counterpart and therefore can't be transmuted.

#### **Gemstone Turret**

Starting at 14th level, you can create a levitating, magical turret at a point you choose within 5 feet. Your gemstones orbit the turret. For 1 hour, you can cast Gem Magic as though you were in the turret's space, but you must use your own senses. Also, you gain 1 light point at the start of each of your turns.

Any spell targeting a creature or object within 10 feet of the turret must instead target the turret. If the spell has an area of effect, it is reduced to a 5-foot-diameter sphere surrounding the turret. If the turret takes damage as a result of the spell, reduce the damage by 1d12 times the number of light points you have remaining. If you reduce the damage to 0, choose a damage type. The creature that cast the spell becomes vulnerable to damage of the chosen type.

The turret has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your wizard level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if you dismiss it early as an action. At which point, your gemstones return to you.
