### Prologue

Almost 1,000 years ago, in a bid for power, the fiend [Tenebrae](lore#tenebrae) conducted a dark ritual to grow the skeleton of a colossal war machine from the very earth beneath [Discidium](locations#discidium). Flying high above the [Oratory](locations#the-oratory), [Caelum Sol Orbis](lore#caelum-sol-orbis), Grand Paladin, watched in horror as [Mundi Eversor](lore#mundi-eversor) erupted from the ground and strode towards [Profundus](locations#profundus) leaving volcanic ash in its wake. So great was Eversor in size that it seemed to rise from the horizon as great chunks of earth crumbled away from its metallic form.

Caelum and his winged paladins soared across the [Altum Sea](locations#altum-sea) to intercept the colossus. Engulfed in a radiant inferno, Caelum ascended to deliver a final blow to Eversor. The dark heart of Eversor exploded, releasing the [Miasma](lore#the-miasma), a harrowing purple fog that would engulf the land for centuries to come. The magical shock wave enchanted deposits of [resonite](lore#resonance-engines) in the earth and the land began to fracture and rise, creating the [earthmotes](lore#earthmotes). As a fissure opened up around his home, Caelum stood at its centre and raised his wings. A mighty golden shield grew around Profundus, holding back the Miasma as the world transformed forever.

It is the 14th day of Roscidas, [996 PO](timeline#996-po), nearly one millennium after the [Rising](timeline#the-rising). Winter is coming to an end and six adventurers now make their way to [Caelum's Landing](locations#caelums-landing) via the *Calligo Way*, the network of powered cable cars and zip lines that connect [Fundus](locations#fundus) to the [Innermotes](locations#the-innermotes).

### Firien Madizos (Blake)

- **Race:** [Dragonborn (Brass)](https://2014.5e.tools/races.html#dragonborn%20(metallic)_ftd), Non-binary

- **Background:** [Guild Artisan](https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#guild%20artisan_phb)

A brass pillar of *Madanau*'s community, Firien Madizos received the divine blessing of *Bahamut* six months ago when their home was attacked by fiends from the *Miasma*. Consigned to studying at the *Oratory* among the Caelumites, they have been asked to help staff the Guilds Exhibition on *Caelum's Landing*. Perhaps these pastries from home will help placate the crowd.

### Gomruss Yardos Bandorul (Ethan)

- **Race:** [Dragonborn (Gold)](https://2014.5e.tools/races.html#dragonborn%20(metallic)_ftd), Male
- **Class:** [Wizard (Graviturgy)](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#wizard_phb,state:sub-graviturgy-egw=b1)
- **Background:** [Gambler](https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#gambler_ai)


Gomruss Yardos Bandorul found brief but bountiful success after inventing the popular game *Dice Monarchs*. Unfortunately, his penchant for gambling has landed him in tremendous debt. Rejected by *Caelum's Landing University* and several arcane guilds, Gomruss is on his way to the Guilds Exhibition in hopes of finding a new job; a difficult task with debt collectors on your golden tail.

### Arti (Josie)

- **Race:** [Warforged](https://2014.5e.tools/races.html#warforged_erlw), Non-binary
- **Class:** [Barbarian (Beast)](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#barbarian_phb,state:sub-beast-tce=b1)
- **Background:** [Investigator](https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#investigator_vrgr)

A hulking automaton with the guise of a plague doctor, Arti has few memories to their name. They awoke in the Miasma not a fortnight ago with only flashes of their master's face to guide them. They have made their way to the *Relief* in hopes of finding the key to unlocking their memories. An alcove in their chest seems to suggest a part of them is missing.

### Blythe Nettleford (Oak)

- **Race:** [Half-Elf](https://2014.5e.tools/races.html#half-elf_phb), Female
- **Class:** [Ranger (Gloom Stalker)](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#ranger_phb,state:sub-gloom-stalker-xge=b1)
- **Background:** [Investigator](https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#investigator_vrgr)

An amateur detective with a sheltered background and few social skills, this sly half-elf is headed to Caelum's Landing, hot on the trail of a missing person. *Naal Berevan*, a young and ambitious herald of Caelum, has not written to his family in months. Perhaps they could make enquiries at the Guilds Exhibition. This case might hold the key to proving their conspiracy theory.

### *Guy Brush* (Joe)

- **Race:** [Half-Elf](https://2014.5e.tools/races.html#half-elf_phb), Male
- **Class:** [Rogue (Swashbuckler)](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#rogue_phb,state:sub-swashbuckler-xge=b1)
- **Background:** [Noble](https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#noble_phb)

Disenchanted with his life as the heir to a mighty trade empire, this dashing half-elf threw his lot in with a crew of pirates in the *Manyshells*. After narrowly escaping a mutiny, Guy secedes to a new captain, *Bhaldrom Anchorheart*, who gives him an impossible task: retrieve a gemlock weapon from Caelum's Landing or face the wrath of *Umberlee*.

### *Bantonio Anderas* (Rachael)

- **Race:** [Human](https://2014.5e.tools/races.html#human_phb), Male
- **Class:** [Fighter (Battle Master)](https://2014.5e.tools/classes.html#fighter_phb,state:sub-battle-master-phb=b1)
- **Background:** [Noble (Knight)](https://2014.5e.tools/backgrounds.html#variant%20noble%20(knight)_phb)

The philandering third child of a noble family, this recently inducted knight of the *Diamond Guard* was caught having an affair with Queen *Carina Diamante IV*. Though requited, his love for her inevitably led him to the business end of *Rafael de Florencia*'s rapier. Having secretly survived his fall from the castle balcony, the battle master must now adopt a new identity to travel the Relief.
