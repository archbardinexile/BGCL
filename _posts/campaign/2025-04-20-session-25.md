title: Session 25 Wings of Justice
---

**Firien**'s eyes glow with intent. Perhaps it was time the *Six of Steel* met Grand Paladin *Spiro Sol Orbis*. **Guy** struggles to sleep while **Arti** whispers to Firien. The warforged wishes to learn more about the dragonborn's faith. Firien obliges with some encouraging words before quietly making an exit. While Firien seeks peace in the arms of a gentle Sunite, Arti settles down to pray for the first time. Reaching out to *Bahamut*, Arti is granted a vision of the platinum dragon's wings engulfing him. The wings part to reveal a stone pillar atop a grassy knoll amidst the Miasma.

The dragon lowers his enormous head to greet Arti and taps the top of the pillar with his talon. The pillar emits a shock wave that disperses the Miasma, revealing a verdant grassy landscape before distant snow-capped mountains. Arti notes the lack of earthmotes on the horizon and quickly memorises the inscription on the pillar. Arti reaches out his hand to thank Bahamut and wakes at the touch of cold metallic scales. Guy almost pulls his pistol on Arti as he hears the warforged scribbling midnight notes.

## **996, Roscidas 21st**

**Gomruss** is the first to wake as he hears the voice of Doctor *Gurdeep Darshan* in his head. Gomruss decides to decline the archaeologist's job offer, suggesting he seek out Professor *Roshia Cralee*, a fellow graviturgy wizard, instead. This reminds Gomruss to contact Roshia. She seems relieved an expedition to rescue *Glimback* is finally being planned and requests specifications for the Arxian glass. While Gomruss liaises with *Zephan* and *Eureka*, Arti shows Firien his drawings.

The pair bristle with excitement when they discover they shared the same vision.
