### The Miasma

**Guy**, concerned by the limited visibility, orders ahead slow. **Arti** closes his eyes and reaches out. Though he cannot determine the distance to his heart, his instincts draw him west-south-west. *Tuperk* brings the *Verity* onto a matching course. *Spiro* takes command while Guy, **Bantonio** and **Blythe** go below deck to check on **Gomruss**. Bantonio offers the trembling dragonborn a soothing mug of miso soup. With some encouragement from his peers, Gomruss shakes off his nerves.

Spiro calls for Captain Brush to return to the bridge and the *Six of Steel* take their stations on deck. An earthmote storm is headed straight for them! Guy orders the crew to hold fast as he takes evasive manoeuvres. Two small earthmotes soar across the stern while a third hurtles toward the hull. **Firien** sprints starboard and summons a gust of wind to redirect the earthmote beneath the Verity. Spotting two larger earthmotes ahead, Gomruss plants his staff. His new spell activates just in time, drawing the two earthmotes together and out of the Verity's path.

Arti realises the Verity must lose altitude to avoid the storm. He calls out to Guy just as another earthmote comes into view. Guy pushes the wheel and the Verity begins to dive. The crew secure themselves to the rigging to avoid sliding down the polished deck. Firien and Bantonio catch the cannons before they come loose. Realising the earthmote is too large to evade, Guy summons the monks. A globe of radiant light deflects the earthmote upward, but it snaps the top the of the mast! Guy breathes a sigh of relief when Arti signals the all clear. He puts the crew to work repairing the mast.

Using Guy's spyglass, Blythe enters earthmotes of interest into the ship's log. The Verity sails over an expansive earthmote jutting out from the sea. A shore of festering seaweed gives way to tainted grey sand dunes. Curiously, the earthmote's centre features a radial formation of spiky rocks. Firien notices cacti and vines thriving around the formation. A portal to the elemental plane of earth was buried beneath the sand and it was sustaining the plant life. Further ahead, Bantonio spies a portal to the elemental plane of water. The glowing whirpool seems to change the colour of the sea as if warding off the pollution.

Up ahead, a huge sandstone earthmote is bisected by an aeolian canyon. Guy sees thousands of tunnels forming a hive-like structure in the walls. Hoping *Glimback*'s expedition sought shelter in the hive, Arti suggests they anchor the Verity atop the canyon and investigate. *Hadley* and the Six of Steel trek to the edge of the canyon where they find two abandoned tents. Inside, Gomruss finds a leather-bound diary in a rucksack. The owner recounts how he joined an expedition to search for resources after his home was consumed by the Miasma. Only he and his friend survived. They decided to investigate the hive two years ago. The Six of Steel follow the trail and abseil down the canyon wall.

### The Hive

Arti's lantern repels the shadows, revealing a network of tunnels, circular in cross section. The walls appear smooth as if hollowed out by a creature. Alcoves in the walls house candles which Gomruss lights as they move forward. Blythe is spooked by an insectoid chattering noise as they party approach the central chamber, weapons ready.
