title: The Church of Caelum (Faction)
---

The Church of Caelum is the most prominent nation in the [Relief](), with territories stretching as far as the [Miasma](). Its capital, [Caelum's Landing](), is the largest and most populous city in the Relief, with much of the region's trade passing through its markets. The Church has remained the most influential and widespread religion in Fio for 1,000 years. The Church shares governance of its territories with the Ministry, making the nation a *constitutional theocracy*. The Church seeks to establish order by expanding its influence and assisting in the development of newfound earthmotes. Though tolerant of other religions, the Church's ubiquity often seems to overwhelm other nascent cultures and religions.

Aura Sol Orbis was born on the 14th day of Viridis in the Oratory on Caelum's Landing. As the first of *Ardeat Sol Orbis*' four children, much of her upbringing was focused on preparing her for the day she would inevitably take over as Exarch. Though she shared a close relationship with her father, her politics would grow apart from his as she watched him perpetuate the [Medusae Wars]() and the Church's expansionist practices. Aura has warm-tinted brown skin and sky-blue eyes much like her father, and sports a long afro gathered into a high ponytail. She and her siblings bare the silver Sol Orbis halo on their foreheads. Those who are granted audience with Aura see her as a kind and understanding soul, while those closest to her know her to be solemn and somewhat lonesome. Following the natural death of her father, Aura was heralded as the new Exarch in a grand coronation on the 11th day of Flavum. Accepting her crown, Aura took her chosen oath of redemption as a paladin of the Church, swearing to right the wrongs of the Medusae Wars and help those affected reintegrate into society. She would go on to declare her brother, *Spiro*, Grand Paladin and Prefect of Ingenium, her sibling, *Sana*, Prefect of [Madanau]() and her sister *Clara*, Prefect of [Tenebrae's Refuge]().
