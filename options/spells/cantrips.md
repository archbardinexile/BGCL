## **Joy's Mailed Mockery**

*Enchantment cantrip*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Components:** S, M (a sheet of parchment, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You scribble a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments onto a sheet of parchment. The parchment folds itself into a paper plane and flies towards the target. If the target opens the parchment, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

There is a chance the parchment will be damaged when travelling distances over 120 feet. The DM may ask for an ability check to determine whether or not the spell reaches its target.
